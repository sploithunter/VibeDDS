Additional Information 
6.1 
Changes to Adopted OMG Specifications 
This specification does not change any adopted OMG specifications. It forms a supplement to the OMG DDS 
specification (see https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/1.4/). 
6.2 
How to Read this Specification 
This specification defines the DDS Interoperability Protocol. Readers not familiar with DDS will benefit from 
first reading the DDS specification. 
For a very high-level overview of RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) and a brief description of the structure 
of this document, please refer to the Introduction. Subsequent clauses cover RTPS in much greater detail. 
While providing both a PIM (Platform Independent Model) and a PSM (Platform Specific Model) contributed 
to the size of this document, this approach also enables a selective reader to easily pick the sub clauses of 
interest: 
• 
Readers who are new to RTPS can start by reading the Structure and Messages Modules of the 
PIM. These Modules provide an overview of the RTPS protocol actors, how they relate to DDS 
Entities, what RTPS messages exist and how they are structured. 
• 
Readers who would like to explore the RTPS message exchange protocol can read the first part 
of the Behavior Module. RTPS is a fairly flexible protocol and allows implementations to 
customize their behavior depending on how much ‘state’ they wish to keep on remote 
Endpoints. The first part of the Behavior Module lists the general requirements any compliant 
implementation of RTPS must satisfy to remain interoperable with other  implementations. 
• 
The second part of the Behavior Module defines two reference implementations. One reference 
implementation maintains full state on remote Endpoints, the other none. This sub clause may be 
of interest to readers who want a more detailed understanding of the RTPS message exchange 
protocol, but it could easily be skipped by first-time readers. 
• 
Readers interested in how RTPS handles dynamic discovery of remote Endpoints are referred to 
the stand-alone Discovery Module. 
• 
For readers planning on implementing RTPS or defining a new PSM, the PSM Clause contains a 
detailed discussion on how the RTPS PIM is mapped to the UDP/IP PSM. 
• 
Finally, the clause on data representation defines various data representation mechanisms for use 
with RTPS.

Statement of Maturity 
The protocol specified in this proposal has proven its performance and applicability to data-distribution systems.  
The protocol has had more that a dozen independent implementations, both commercial and open source. These 
products had been deployed in hundreds of thousands of applications worldwide in the 14 years since this 
specification was initially adopted. 
The OMG has performed interoperability demonstrations among many different implementations, including the 
DDS/RTPS implementations from Real-Time Innovations (Connext DDS and Connext DDS Micro), ADLink 
(OpenSplice DDS, Vortex Cafe, and CycloneDDS), TwinOaks Computing (CoreDX DDS), Kongsberg 
(InterComm DDS), Object Computing Incorporated (OpenDDS), and eProsima (FastRTPS).

Overview 
7.1 
Introduction 
The recently-adopted Data-Distribution Service specification defines an Application Level Interface and 
behavior of a Data-Distribution Service (DDS) that supports Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe (DCPS) in real-
time systems. The DDS specification used a Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach to precisely describe 
the Data-Centric communications model specifically: 
• 
How the application models the data it wishes to send and receive. 
• 
How the application interacts with the DCPS middleware and specifies the data it wishes to send 
and receive as well as the quality of service (QoS) requirements. 
• 
How data is sent and received (relative to the QoS requirements). 
• 
How the applications access the data. 
• 
The kinds of feedback the application gets from the state of the middleware. 
The DDS specification also includes a platform specific mapping to IDL and therefore an application using 
DDS is able to switch among DDS implementations with only a re-compile. DDS therefore addresses 
‘application portability.’ 
The DDS specification does not address the protocol used by the implementation to exchange messages over 
transports such as TCP/UDP/IP, so different implementations of DDS will not interoperate with each other 
unless vendor-specific “bridges” are provided. The situation is therefore similar to that of other messaging 
API standards such as JMS. 
With the increasing adoption of DDS in large distributed systems, it is desirable to define a standard “wire 
protocol” that allows DDS implementations from multiple vendors to interoperate. The desired “DDS wire 
protocol” should be capable of taking advantage of the QoS settings configurable by DDS to optimize its use of 
the underlying transport capabilities. In particular, the desired wire protocol must be capable of exploiting the 
multicast, best-effort, and connectionless nature of many of the DDS QoS settings. 
7.2 
Requirements for a DDS Wire-protocol 
In network communications, as in many other fields of engineering, it is a fact that “one size does not fit all.” 
Engineering design is about making the right set of trade-offs, and these trade-offs must balance conflicting 
requirements such as generality, ease of use, richness of features, performance, memory size and usage, 
scalability, determinism, and robustness. These trade-offs must be made in light of the types of information flow 
(e.g., periodic vs. bursty, state-based vs. event-based, one-to-many vs. request-reply, best-effort vs. reliable, 
small data-values vs. large files, etc.), and the constraints imposed by the application and execution platforms. 
Consequently, many successful protocols have emerged such as HTTP, SOAP, FTP, DHCP, DCE, RTP, DCOM, 
and CORBA. Each of these protocols fills a niche, providing well- tuned functionality for specific purposes or 
application domains. 
The basic communication model of DDS is one of unidirectional data exchange where the applications that 
publish data “push” the relevant data updates to the local caches of co-located subscribers to the data. This 
information flow is regulated by QoS contracts implicitly established between the DataWriters and the 
DataReaders. The DataWriter specifies its QoS contract at the time it declares its intent to publish data and the 
DataReader does it at the time it declares its intent to subscribe to data. The communication patterns typically 
include many-to-many style configurations. Of primary concern to applications deploying DDS technology is 
that the information is distributed in an efficient manner with minimal overhead. Another important requirement 
is the need to scale to hundreds or thousands of subscribers in a robust fault-tolerant manner. 
The DDS specification prescribes the presence of a built-in discovery service that allows publishers to 
dynamically discover the existence of subscribers and vice-versa and performs this task continuously without 
the need to contact any name servers.

The DDS specification also prescribes that the implementations should not introduce any single points of 
failure. Consequently, protocols must not rely on centralized name servers or centralized information brokers. 
The large scale, loosely-coupled, dynamic nature of applications deploying DDS and the need to adapt to 
emerging transports require certain flexibility on the data-definition and protocol such that each can be evolved 
while preserving backwards compatibility with already deployed systems. 
7.3 
The RTPS Wire-protocol 
The Real-Time Publish Subscribe (RTPS) protocol found its roots in industrial automation and was in fact 
approved by the IEC as part of the Real-Time Industrial Ethernet Suite IEC-PAS-62030. It is a field proven 
technology that is currently deployed worldwide in thousands of industrial devices. 
RTPS was specifically developed to support the unique requirements of data-distributions systems. As one of 
the application domains targeted by DDS, the industrial automation community defined requirements for a 
standard publish- subscribe wire-protocol that closely match those of DDS. As a direct result, a close synergy 
exists between DDS and the RTPS wire-protocol, both in terms of the underlying behavioral architecture and 
the features of RTPS. 
The RTPS protocol is designed to be able to run over multicast and connectionless best-effort transports such as 
UDP/IP. The main features of the RTPS protocol include: 
• 
Performance and quality-of-service properties to enable best-effort and reliable publish-
subscribe communications for real-time applications over standard IP networks. 
• 
Fault tolerance to allow the creation of networks without single points of failure. 
• 
Extensibility to allow the protocol to be extended and enhanced with new services without 
breaking backwards compatibility and interoperability. 
• 
Plug-and-play connectivity so that new applications and services are automatically discovered 
and applications can join and leave the network at any time without the need for reconfiguration. 
• 
Configurability to allow balancing the requirements for reliability and timeliness for each data 
delivery. 
• 
Modularity to allow simple devices to implement a subset of the protocol and still participate in 
the network. 
• 
Scalability to enable systems to potentially scale to very large networks. 
• 
Type-safety to prevent application programming errors from compromising the operation of 
remote nodes. 
The above features make RTPS an excellent match for a DDS wire-protocol. Given its publish-subscribe roots, 
this is not a coincidence, as RTPS was specifically designed for meeting the types of requirements set forth by 
the DDS application domain. 
This specification defines the message formats, interpretation, and usage scenarios that underlie all messages 
exchanged by applications that use the RTPS protocol. 
7.4 
The RTPS Platform Independent Model (PIM) 
The RTPS protocol is described in terms of a Platform Independent Model (PIM) and a set of PSMs. 
The RTPS PIM contains four modules: Structure, Messages, Behavior, and Discovery. The Structure module 
defines the communication endpoints. The Messages module defines the set of messages that those endpoints 
can exchange. The Behavior module defines sets of legal interactions (message exchanges) and how they affect 
the state of the communication endpoints. In other words, the Structure module defines the protocol “actors,” 
the Messages module the set of “grammatical symbols,” and the Behavior module the legal grammar and 
semantics of the different conversations. The Discovery module defines how entities are automatically 
discovered and configured.

## Page 15

Figure 7.1 - RTPS Modules 
In the PIM, the messages are defined in terms of their semantic content. This PIM can then be mapped to 
various Platform-Specific Models (PSMs) such as plain UDP or CORBA-events. 
7.4.1 
The Structure Module 
Given its publish-subscribe roots, RTPS maps naturally to many DDS concepts. This specification uses many of 
the same core entities used in the DDS specification. As illustrated in Figure 7.2, all RTPS entities are 
associated with an RTPS domain, which represents a separate communication plane that contains a set of 
Participants. A Participant contains Groups which contain local Endpoints. There are two kinds of endpoints: 
Readers and Writers. Readers and Writers are the actors that communicate information by sending RTPS 
messages. Writers inform of the presence and send locally available data on the Domain to the Readers which 
can request and acknowledge the data. 
 
Figure 7.2 - RTPS Structure Module 
The Actors in the RTPS Protocol are in one-to-one correspondence with the DDS Entities that are the reason for 
the communication to occur. This is illustrated in Figure 7.3.

Figure 7.3 - Correspondence between RTPS and DDS Entries 
The Structure module is described in 8.2. 
7.4.2 
The Messages Module 
The messages module defines the content of the atomic information exchanges between RTPS Writers and 
Readers. Messages are composed of a Header followed by a number of Submessages, as illustrated in Figure 
7.4. Each Submessage is built from a series of Submessage elements. This structure is chosen to allow the 
vocabulary of Submessages and the composition of each Submessage to be extended while maintaining 
backward compatibility. The HeaderExtension is a special Submessage that may optionally appear 
immediately following the Header.  
 
Figure 7.4 - RTPS Messages Module 
The Messages module is discussed at length in 8.3. 
7.4.3 
The Behavior Module 
The Behavior module describes the allowed sequences of messages that can be exchanged between RTPS 
Writers and Readers as well as the timings and changes in the state of the Writer and the Reader caused by each 
message.

## Page 17

The required behavior for interoperability is described in terms of a minimum set of rules that an 
implementation must follow in order to be interoperable. Actual implementations may exhibit different behavior 
beyond these minimum requirements, depending on how they wish to trade-off scalability, memory 
requirements, and bandwidth usage. 
To illustrate this concept, the Behavior module defines two reference implementations. One reference 
implementation is based on StatefulWriters and StatefulReaders, the other on StatelessWriters and 
StatelessReaders, as illustrated in  Figure 7.2 - RTPS Structure Module. Both reference implementations 
satisfy the minimum requirements for interoperability, and are therefore interoperable, but exhibit slightly  
different behavior due to the difference in information they store on matching remote entities. The behavior of 
an actual implementation of the RTPS protocol may be an exact match or a combination of that of the reference 
implementations. 
The Behavior module is described in 8.4. 
7.4.4 
The Discovery Module 
The Discovery module describes the protocol that enables Participants to obtain information about the 
existence and attributes of all the other Participants and Endpoints in the Domain. This metatraffic enables 
every Participant to obtain a complete picture of all Participants, Readers and Writers in the Domain and 
configure the local Writers to communicate with the remote Readers and the local Readers to communicate 
with the remote Writers. 
Discovery is a separate module. The unique needs of Discovery, namely the transparent plug-and-play 
dissemination of all the information needed to associate matching Writers and Readers make it unlikely that a 
single architecture or protocol can fulfill the extremely variable scalability, performance, and embeddability 
needs of the various heterogeneous networks where DDS will be deployed. Henceforth, it makes sense to 
introduce several discovery mechanisms ranging from the simple and efficient (but not very scalable), to a 
more complex hierarchical (but more scalable) mechanism. 
The Discovery module is described in 8.5. 
7.5 
The RTPS Platform Specific Model (PSM) 
A Platform Specific Model maps the RTPS PIM to a specific underlying platform. It defines the precise 
representation in bits and bytes of all RTPS Types and Messages and any other information specific to the 
platform. 
Multiple PSMs may be supported, but all implementations of DDS must at least implement the PSM on top of 
UDP/IP, which is presented in Clause 9. 
7.6 
The RTPS Transport Model 
RTPS supports a wide variety of transports and transport QoS. The protocol is designed to be able to run on 
multicast and best-effort transports, such as UDP/IP and requires only very simple services from the transport. 
In fact, it is sufficient that the transport offers a connectionless service capable of sending packets best-effort. 
That is, the transport need not guarantee each packet will reach its destination or that packets are delivered in-
order. Where required, RTPS implements reliability in the transfer of data and state above the transport 
interface. This does not preclude RTPS from being implemented on top of a reliable transport. It simply 
makes it possible to support a wider range of transports. 
If available, RTPS can also take advantage of the multicast capabilities of the transport mechanism, where one 
message from a sender can reach multiple receivers. RTPS is designed to promote determinism of the 
underlying communication mechanism. The protocol provides an open trade-off between determinism and 
reliability.

## Page 18

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
12
The general requirements RTPS poses on the underlying transport can be summarized as follows: 
• 
The transport has a generalized notion of a unicast address (shall fit within 16 bytes). 
• 
The transport has a generalized notion of a port (shall fit within 4 bytes), e.g., could be a UDP 
port, an offset in a shared memory segment, etc. 
• 
The transport can send a datagram (uninterpreted sequence of octets) to a specific address/port. 
• 
The transport can receive a datagram at a specific address/port. 
• 
The transport will drop messages if incomplete or corrupted during transfer (i.e., RTPS assumes 
messages are complete and not corrupted).

Platform Independent Model (PIM) 
8.1 
Introduction 
This clause defines the Platform Independent Model (PIM) for the RTPS protocol. Subsequent clauses map the 
PIM to a variety of platforms, the most fundamental one being native UDP packets. 
The PIM describes the protocol in terms of a “virtual machine.” The structure of the virtual machine is built 
from the classes described in 8.2, which include Writer and Reader endpoints. These endpoints communicate 
using the messages described in 8.3. Sub clause 8.4 describes the behavior of the virtual machine, i.e., what 
message exchanges take place between the endpoints. It lists the requirements for interoperability and defines 
two reference implementations using state- diagrams. Sub clause 8.5 defines the discovery protocol used to 
configure the virtual machine with the information it needs to communicate with its remote peers. Sub clause 
8.6 describes how the protocol can be extended for future needs. Finally, 8.7 describes how to implement DDS 
QoS and some advanced DDS features using RTPS. 
The only purpose of introducing the RTPS virtual machine is to describe the protocol in a complete and un-
ambiguous manner. This description is not intended to constrain the internal implementation in any way. The 
only criteria for a compliant implementation is that the externally-observable behavior satisfies the requirements 
for interoperability. In particular, an implementation could be based on other classes and could use 
programming constructs other than state- machines to implement the RTPS protocol. 
8.2 
Structure Module 
This sub clause describes the structure of the RTPS entities that are the communication actors. The main classes 
used by the RTPS protocol are shown in Figure 8.1. 
8.2.1 
Overview 
RTPS entities are the protocol-level endpoints used by the application-visible DDS entities in order to 
communicate with each other. 
Each RTPS Entity is in a one-to-one correspondence with a DDS Entity. The HistoryCache forms the interface 
between the DDS Entities and their corresponding RTPS Entities. For example, each write operation on a DDS 
DataWriter adds a CacheChange to the HistoryCache of its corresponding RTPS Writer. The RTPS Writer 
subsequently transfers the CacheChange to the HistoryCache of all matching RTPS Readers. On the receiving 
side, the DDS DataReader is notified by the RTPS Reader that a new CacheChange has arrived in the 
HistoryCache, at which point the DDS DataReader may choose to access it using the DDS read or take API.

Figure 8.1 - RTPS Structure Module 
This sub clause provides an overview of the main classes used by the RTPS virtual machine and the types used 
to describe their attributes. Subsequent sub clauses describe each class in detail. 
8.2.1.1 
Summary of the classes used by the RTPS virtual machine 
All RTPS entities derive from the RTPS Entity class. Table 8.1 lists the classes used by the RTPS virtual 
machine. 
Table 8.1 - Overview of RTPS Entities and Classes 
RTPS Entities and Classes 
Class 
Purpose 
Entity 
Base class for all RTPS entities. RTPS Entity represents the class of objects that are 
visible to other RTPS Entities on the network. As such, RTPS Entity objects have a 
globally-unique identifier (GUID) and can be referenced inside RTPS messages. 
Endpoint 
Specialization of RTPS Entity representing the objects that can be communication 
endpoints. That is, the objects that can be the sources or destinations of RTPS messages. 
Participant 
Container of all RTPS entities that share common properties and are located in a 
single address space.

## Page 21

DDSI-RTPS v2.5

Writer 
Specialization of RTPS Endpoint representing the objects that can be the sources of 
messages communicating CacheChanges. 
Reader 
Specialization of RTPS Endpoint representing the objects that can be used to receive 
messages communicating CacheChanges. 
HistoryCache 
Container class used to temporarily store and manage sets of changes to data-objects. 
On the Writer side it contains the history of the changes to data-objects made by the 
Writer. It is not necessary that the full history of all changes ever made is maintained. 
Rather what is needed is the partial history required to service existing and future 
matched RTPS Reader endpoints. The partial history needed depends on the DDS 
QoS and the state of the communications with the matched Reader endpoints. 
On the Reader side it contains the history of the changes to data-objects made by the 
matched RTPS Writer endpoints. It is not necessary that the full history of all changes 
ever received is maintained. Rather what is needed is a partial history containing the 
superposition of the changes received from the matched writers as needed to satisfy 
the needs of the corresponding DDS DataReader. The rules for this superposition and 
the amount of partial history required depend on the DDS QoS and the state of the 
communication with the matched RTPS Writer endpoints. 
CacheChange 
Represents an individual change made to a data-object. Includes the creation, 
modification, and deletion of data-objects. 
Data 
Represents the data that may be associated with a change made to a data-object. 
8.2.1.2 
Summary of the types used to describe RTPS Entities and Classes 
The Entities and Classes used by the virtual machine each contain a set of attributes. The types of the attributes 
are summarized in Table 8.2.

8.2.1.3 
Configuration attributes of the RTPS Entities 
RTPS entities are configured by a set of attributes. Some of these attributes map to the QoS policies set on the 
corresponding DDS entities. Other attributes represent parameters that allow tuning the behavior of the protocol 
to specific transport and deployment situations. Additional attributes encode the state of the RTPS Entity and 
are not used to configure the behavior. 
The attributes used to configure a subset of the RTPS Entities are shown in Figure 8.2. The attributes to 
configure Writer and Reader Entities are closely tied to the protocol behavior and will be introduced in 8.4. 
 
Figure 8.2 - Attributes used to configure the main RTPS Entities 
The remainder of this sub clause describes each of the RTPS entities in more detail. 
8.2.2 
The RTPS HistoryCache 
The HistoryCache is part of the interface between DDS and RTPS and plays different roles on the reader and 
the writer side. 
On the writer side, the HistoryCache contains the partial history of changes to data-objects made by the 
corresponding DDS Writer that are needed to service existing and future matched RTPS Reader endpoints. The 
partial history needed depends on the DDS Qos and the state of the communications with the matched RTPS 
Reader endpoints. 
On the reader side, it contains the partial superposition of changes to data-objects made by all the matched 
RTPS Writer endpoints. 
The word “partial” is used to indicate that it is not necessary that the full history of all changes ever made is 
maintained. Rather what is needed is the subset of the history needed to meet the behavioral needs of the RTPS 
protocol and the QoS needs of the related DDS entities. The rules that define this subset are defined by the 
RTPS protocol and depend both on the state of the communications protocol and on the QoS of the related 
DDS entities. 
The HistoryCache is part of the interface between DDS and RTPS. In other words, both the RTPS entities and 
their related DDS entities are able to invoke the operations on their associated HistoryCache.

new 
This operation creates a new RTPS HistoryCache. The newly-created history cache is initialized with an empty 
list of changes. 
8.2.2.2 
add_change 
This operation inserts the CacheChange a_change into the HistoryCache. 
This operation will only fail if there are not enough resources to add the change to the HistoryCache. It is the 
responsibility of the DDS service implementation to configure the HistoryCache in a manner consistent with 
the DDS Entity RESOURCE_LIMITS QoS and to propagate any errors to the DDS-user in the manner specified 
by the DDS specification. 
This operation performs the following logical steps: 
ADD a_change TO this.changes; 
8.2.2.3 
remove_change 
This operation indicates that a previously-added CacheChange should be removed from the HistoryCache and 
the details regarding the CacheChange need not be maintained in the HistoryCache. The determination of 
which changes should be removed from the cache is made based on the QoS associated with the related DDS 
entity and on the acknowledgment status of the CacheChange. This is described in 8.4.1. 
This operation performs the following logical steps: 
REMOVE a_change FROM this.changes; 
8.2.2.4 
get_seq_num_min 
This operation retrieves the smallest value of the CacheChange::sequenceNumber attribute among the 
CacheChange stored in the HistoryCache. This operation performs the following logical steps: 
min_seq_num := MIN { change.sequenceNumber WHERE (change IN this.changes) }  
return min_seq_num; 
8.2.2.5 
get_seq_num_max 
This operation retrieves the largest value of the CacheChange::sequenceNumber attribute among the 
CacheChange stored in the HistoryCache. 
This operation performs the following logical steps: 
max_seq_num := MAX { change.sequenceNumber WHERE (change IN this.changes) }  
return max_seq_num;

PSM. 
The implementation is free to choose the prefix, as long as every Participant in the Domain has a unique GUID. 
8.2.4.3 
The GUIDs of Endpoint Groups within a Participant 
The endpoint Groups contained by a Participant with GUID < participantPrefix, ENTITYID_PARTICIPANT> 
have the GUID <participantPrefix, entityId>. The entityId is the unique identification of the Group relative to 
the Participant. This has several consequences: 
• 
The GUIDs of all the Groups within a Participant have the same prefix. 
• 
Once the GUID of a Group is known, the GUID of the Participant that contains the endpoint is 
also known. 
• 
The GUID of any Group can be deduced from the GUID of the Participant to which it belongs 
and its entityId. The selection of entityId for each RTPS Entity depends on the PSM. 
8.2.4.4 
The GUIDs of the RTPS Endpoints within a Participant 
The Endpoints contained by a Participant with GUID <participantPrefix, ENTITYID_PARTICIPANT> have the 
GUID <participantPrefix, entityId>. The entityId is the unique identification of the Endpoint relative to the 
Participant. This has several consequences: 
• 
The GUIDs of all the Endpoints within a Participant have the same prefix. 
• 
Once the GUID of an Endpoint is known, the GUID of the Participant that contains the 
endpoint is also known. 
• 
The GUID of any endpoint can be deduced from the GUID of the Participant to which it belongs 
and its entityId. The selection of entityId for each RTPS Entity depends on the PSM.

The RTPS Participant 
RTPS Participant is the container of RTPS Group entities which contain Endpoint entities. The RTPS 
Participant maps to a DDS DomainParticipant.

Publisher. 
• 
The RTPS Subscriber contains RTPS Reader endpoints. The RTPS Subscriber maps to a DDS 
Subscriber. 
8.2.7 
The RTPS Endpoint 
RTPS Endpoint represents the possible communication endpoints from the point of view of the RTPS protocol. 
There are two kinds of RTPS Endpoint entities: Writer endpoints and Reader endpoints. 
RTPS Writer endpoints send CacheChange messages to RTPS Reader endpoints and potentially receive 
acknowledgments for the changes they send. RTPS Reader endpoints receive CacheChange and change-
availability announcements from Writer endpoints and potentially acknowledge the changes and/or request 
missed changes. 
RTPS Endpoint contains the attributes shown in Table 8.9.

An RTPS Writer belongs to an RTPS Group of type Publisher. 
The attributes to configure an RTPS Writer are closely tied to the protocol behavior and will be introduced in 
the Behavior Module (8.4). 
8.2.9 
The RTPS Reader 
RTPS Reader specializes RTPS Endpoint and represents the actor that receives CacheChange messages from 
the matched RTPS Writer endpoints. 
An RTPS Reader belongs to an RTPS Group of type Subscriber. 
The attributes to configure an RTPS Reader are closely tied to the protocol behavior and will be introduced in 
the Behavior Module (8.4). 
8.2.10 Relation to DDS Entities 
As mentioned in 8.2.2, the HistoryCache forms the interface between DDS Entities and their corresponding 
RTPS Entities. A DDS DataWriter, for example, passes data to its matching RTPS Writer through the 
common HistoryCache. 
How exactly a DDS Entity interacts with the HistoryCache however, is implementation specific and not 
formally modeled by the RTPS protocol. Instead, the Behavior Module of the RTPS protocol only specifies how 
CacheChange changes are transferred from the HistoryCache of the RTPS Writer to the HistoryCache of 
each matching RTPS Reader. 
Despite the fact that it is not part of the RTPS protocol, it is important to know how a DDS Entity may interact 
with the HistoryCache to obtain a complete understanding of the protocol. This topic forms the subject of this 
sub clause. 
The interactions are described using UML state diagrams. The abbreviations used to refer to DDS and RTPS 
Entities are listed in Table 8.10 below.

8.2.10.1 The DDS DataWriter 
The write operation on a DDS DataWriter adds CacheChange changes to the HistoryCache of its associated 
RTPS Writer. As such, the HistoryCache contains a history of the most recently written changes. The number 
of changes is determined by QoS settings on the DDS DataWriter such as the HISTORY and 
RESOURCE_LIMITS QoS. 
By default, all changes in the HistoryCache are considered relevant for each matching remote RTPS Reader. 
That is, the Writer should attempt to send all changes in the HistoryCache to the matching remote Readers. 
How to do this is the subject of the Behavior Module of the RTPS protocol.

## Page 31

DDSI-RTPS v2.5

Changes may not be sent to a remote Reader for two reasons: 
• 
they have been removed from the HistoryCache by the DDS DataWriter and are no longer available. 
• 
they are considered not relevant to this Reader. 
The DDS DataWriter may decide to remove changes from the HistoryCache for several reasons. For example, 
only a limited number of changes may need to be stored based on the HISTORY QoS settings. Alternatively, a 
sample may have expired due to the LIFESPAN QoS. When using strict reliable communication, a change can 
only be removed when it has been acknowledged by all readers the change was sent to and which are still 
active and alive. 
Not all changes may be relevant for each matching remote Reader as determined by, for example, the 
TIME_BASED_FILTER QoS or through the use of DDS content-filtered topics. Note that whether a change is 
relevant must be determined on a per Reader basis in this case. Implementations may be able to optimize 
bandwidth and/or CPU usage by filtering on the Writer side when possible. Whether this is possible depends on 
whether an implementation keeps track of each individual remote Reader and the QoS and filters that apply to 
this Reader. The Reader itself will always filter. 
QoS or content-based filtering is represented in this document using DDS_FILTER(reader, change), a 
notation which reflects that filtering is reader dependent. Depending on what reader specific information is 
stored by the writer, DDS_FILTER may be a noop. This operation returns ‘true’ if the change passes the filter 
and should be sent to the reader. Otherwise it returns 'false’. For content-based filtering, the RTPS specification 
enables sending information with each change that lists what filters have been applied to the change and which 
filters it passed. If available, this information can then be used by the Reader to filter a change without having 
to call DDS_FILTER. This approach saves CPU cycles by filtering the sample once on the Writer side, as 
opposed to filtering on each Reader. 
The following state-diagram illustrates how the DDS Data Writer adds a change to the HistoryCache.

This transition is triggered by the destruction of a DDS DataWriter ‘the_dds_writer.’ The transition performs 
the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
delete the_dds_writer.related_rtps_writer; 
8.2.10.2 The DDS DataReader 
The DDS DataReader gets its data from the HistoryCache of the corresponding RTPS Reader. The number of 
changes stored in the HistoryCache is determined by QoS settings such as the HISTORY and 
RESOURCE_LIMITS QoS. 
Each matching Writer will attempt to transfer all relevant samples from its HistoryCache to the HistoryCache 
of the Reader. The implementation of the read or take call on the DDS DataReader accesses the HistoryCache. 
The changes returned to the user are those in the HistoryCache that pass all Reader specific filters, if any. 
A Reader filter is equally represented by DDS_FILTER(reader, change). As mentioned above, 
implementations may be able to perform most of the filtering on the Writer side. In that case, samples are either 
never sent (and therefore not present in the HistoryCache of the Reader) or contain information on what filters 
where applied and the corresponding outcome (for content-based filtering). 
A DDS DataReader may also decide to remove changes from the HistoryCache in order to satisfy such QoS as 
TIME_BASED_FILTER. This exact behavior is again implementation specific and is not modeled by the RTPS 
protocol. 
The following state-diagram illustrates how the DDS Data Reader accesses changes in the HistoryCache.

 Transition T2 
This transition is triggered by the act of reading data from the DDS DataReader ‘the_dds_reader’ by means of 
the ‘read’ operation. Changes returned to the application remain in the RTPS Reader’s HistoryCache such that 
subsequent read or take operations can find them again. 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine:

The DDS_FILTER() operation reflects the capabilities of the DDS DataReader API to select a subset of changes 
based on CacheChange::kind, QoS, content-filters and other mechanisms. Note that the logical actions above 
only reflect the behavior and not necessarily the actual implementation of the protocol. 
 Transition T3 
This transition is triggered by the act of reading data from the DDS DataReader ‘the_dds_reader’ by means of 
the ‘take’ operation. Changes returned to the application are removed from the RTPS Reader’s HistoryCache

8.3 
Messages Module 
The Messages module describes the overall structure and logical contents of the messages that are exchanged 
between the RTPS Writer endpoints and RTPS Reader endpoints. RTPS Messages are modular by design and 
can be easily extended to support both standard protocol feature additions as well as vendor-specific 
extensions. 
8.3.1 
Overview 
The Messages module is organized as follows: 
• 
8.3.2 introduces any additional types needed for defining RTPS messages in the subsequent sub 
clauses. 
• 
8.3.3 describes the common structure used for all RTPS Messages. All RTPS Messages consist of 
a Header followed by a series of Submessages. The number of Submessages that can be sent in a 
single RTPS Message is only limited by the maximum message size the underlying transport can 
support. 
• 
Certain Submessages may affect how subsequent Submessages within the same RTPS Message 
must be interpreted. The context for interpreting Submessages is maintained by the RTPS 
Message Receiver and is described in 8.3.4. 
• 
8.3.5 lists the elementary building blocks for creating Submessages, also referred to as 
SubmessageElements. This includes sequence number sets, timestamp, identifiers, etc. 
• 
8.3.6 describes the structure of the RTPS Header. The fixed size RTPS Header is used to identify 
an RTPS Message. 
• 
Finally, 8.3.8 introduces all available Submessages in detail. For each Submessage, the 
specification defines its contents, when it is considered valid and how it affects the state of the 
RTPS Message Receiver. The PSM will define the actual mapping of each of these Submessage 
to bits and bytes on the wire in 9.4.5. 
8.3.2 
Type Definitions 
In addition to the types defined in 8.2.1.2, the Messages module makes use of the types listed in Table 8.13. 
Table 8.13 - Types used to define RTPS messages 
Types used to define RTPS messages 
Type 
Purpose 
ProtocolId_t 
Enumeration used to identify the protocol. 
The following values are reserved by the protocol: 
PROTOCOL_RTPS 
SubmessageFlag 
Type used to specify a Submessage flag. 
A Submessage flag takes a boolean value and affects the parsing of the Submessage 
by the receiver.

## Page 36

DDSI-RTPS v2.5

SubmessageKind 
Enumeration used to identify the kind of Submessage. 
The following values are reserved by this version of the protocol: 
RTPS_HE, DATA, GAP, HEARTBEAT, ACKNACK, PAD, INFO_TS, 
INFO_REPLY, INFO_DST, INFO_SRC, DATA_FRAG, NACK_FRAG, 
HEARTBEAT_FRAG 
Time_t 
Type used to hold a timestamp. 
Should have at least nano-second resolution. 
The following values are reserved by the protocol:  
TIME_ZERO, TIME_INVALID , TIME_INFINITE 
Count_t 
Type used to hold a count that is incremented monotonically, used to identify 
message duplicates. 
Checksum_t 
Type used to hold a checksum. Used to detect RTPS message corruption by the 
underlying transport. 
The following values are reserved by the protocol:  CHECKSUM_INVALID. 
MessageLength_t 
Type used to hold the length of an RTPS Message. 
The following values are reserved by the protocol: 
MESSAGE_LENGTH_INVALID 
ParameterId_t 
Type used to uniquely identify a parameter in a parameter list. 
Used extensively by the Discovery Module mainly to define QoS Parameters. A 
range of values is reserved for protocol-defined parameters, while another range 
can be used for vendor-defined parameters, see 8.3.5.9. 
FragmentNumber_t 
Type used to hold fragment numbers. 
Must be possible to represent using 32 bits. 
GroupDigest_t 
Type used to hold a digest value that uniquely identifies a group of Entities 
belonging to the same Participant. 
UExtension4_t 
Type used to hold an undefined 4-byte value. It is intended to be used in future 
revisions of the specification.  
WExtension8_t 
Type used to hold an undefined 8-byte value. It is intended to be used in future 
revisions of the specification.  
8.3.3 
The Overall Structure of an RTPS Message 
The overall structure of an RTPS Message consists of a fixed-size leading RTPS Header followed by a variable 
number of RTPS Submessage parts. Each Submessage in turn consists of a SubmessageHeader and a variable 
number of SubmessageElements. This is illustrated in Figure 8.8.

## Page 37

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
31 
 
 
 
Figure 8.8 - Structure of RTPS Messages 
Each message sent by the RTPS protocol has a finite length. This length is optionally sent in the RTPS 
HeaderExtension Submessage.  
The length may also be sent by the underlying transport that carries the RTPS message. In this case it may be 
omitted from the HeaderExtension. For example, in the case of a packet-oriented transport (like UDP/IP), the 
length of the message is already provided by the transport headers. In contrast, a stream-oriented transport (like 
TCP) would need to include the length in the RTPS HeaderExtension in order to identify the boundary of the 
RTPS message. 
8.3.3.1 
Header structure 
The RTPS Header must appear at the beginning of every message. 
 
Figure 8.9 - Structure of the RTPS Message Header

## Page 38

The Header identifies the message as belonging to the RTPS protocol. The Header identifies the version of the 
protocol and the vendor that sent the message. The Header contains the fields listed in Table 8.14.

the RTPS protocol. 
guidPrefix 
GuidPrefix_t 
Defines a default prefix to use for all GUIDs that appear in 
the message. 
The structure of the RTPS Header cannot be changed in this major version (2) of the protocol. 
 
protocol 
The protocol identifies the message as an RTPS message. This value is set to PROTOCOL_RTPS. 
 
version 
The version identifies the version of the RTPS protocol. Implementations following this version of the 
document implement protocol version 2.5 (major = 2, minor = 5) and have this field set to 
PROTOCOLVERSION. 
 
vendorId 
The vendorId identifies the vendor of the middleware that implemented the RTPS protocol and allows this 
vendor to add specific extensions to the protocol. The vendorId does not refer to the vendor of the device or 
product that contains RTPS middleware. The possible values for the vendorId are assigned by the OMG. 
The protocol reserves the following value: 
VENDORID_UNKNOWN 
Vendor IDs can only be reserved by implementers that commit to comply with the current major version of the 
protocol. To facilitate incremental evolution, the list of vendor IDs is managed separately from this 
specification. The list is maintained on the OMG DDS website and is accessible at: 
https://portals.omg.org/dds/dds-rtps-vendor-and-product-ids/. 
Requests for new vendor IDs should be sent via email to dds@omg.org 
 
guidPrefix 
The guidPrefix defines a default prefix that can be used to reconstruct the Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) 
that appear within the Submessages contained in the message. The guidPrefix allows Submessages to contain 
only the EntityId part of the GUID and therefore saves from having to repeat the common prefix on every 
GUID (See 8.2.4.1). 
8.3.3.2 
HeaderExtension structure 
The HeaderExtension may optionally appear immediately following the Header. It extends the information 
provided in the Header without breaking interoperability with earlier versions of the RTPS protocol.

Figure 8.10 - Structure of the RTPS Message Header 
The HeaderExtension submessage was introduced in RTPS version 2.5. Earlier versions of the protocol (RTPS 
2.4 and earlier) do not understand the HeaderExtension submessage. However, since the HeaderExtension 
conforms to the sub-message structure (see 8.3.3.3) versions of the protocol that do not understand the 
HeaderExtension will treat it as “unknown messge kind”, skip it, and continue processing the submessages that 
follow it, see 8.3.4.1.

Present only if the ParametersFlag is set in the header.  
Contains information which can be added without breaking 
interoperability between protocol versions. 
 
messageLength 
The messageLength indicates the length of the complete RTPS Message, starting from the beginning of the 
RTPS Header. 
 
rtpsSendTimestamp 
The rtpsSendTimestamp indicates the time when the RTPS message was sent by the originating Participant.  
The timestamp may be used by the receiving application to estimate the time offset between the clocks of the 
sending and receiving Participants. For this reason, the rtpsSendTimestamp shall collected as close as possible 
to the moment when the RTPS Message is sent over the underlying transport.  
The time origin used for the HeaderExtension rtpsSendTimestamp shall be the same as the one used in the 
Timestamp Submessage Element (see 8.3.5.8). 
 
uExtension4 
The uExtension4 is undefined in this version of the protocol. It is intended for future revisions. 
 
wExtension8 
The wExtension8 is undefined in this version of the protocol. It is intended for future revisions. 
 
messageChecksum 
The messageChecksum provides a checksum computed over the complete of the RTPS Message, which 
includes the RTPS Header, the HeaderExtension, and all Submessages that may follow. 
 
parameters 
The parameters provide an extensibility mechanism. It enables revisions of the protocol to add information to 
the HeaderExtension without breaking interoperability with this version, or prior versions, of the RTPS 
protocol. 
8.3.3.3 
Submessage structure 
Each RTPS Message consists of a variable number of RTPS Submessage parts. All RTPS Submessages feature 
the same identical structure shown in Figure 8.11.

Figure 8.11 - Structure of the RTPS Submessages 
 
All Submessages start with a SubmessageHeader part followed by a concatenation of SubmessageElement 
parts. The SubmessageHeader identifies the kind of Submessage and the optional elements within that 
Submessage. The SubmessageHeader contains the fields listed in Table 8.16.

flags 
SubmessageFlag[8] 
Identifies the endianness used to encode the Submessage, 
the presence of optional elements within the Submessage, 
and possibly modifies the interpretation of the Submessage. 
There are 8 possible flags. The first flag (index 0) identifies 
the endianness used to encode the Submessage. The 
remaining flags are interpreted differently depending on the 
kind of Submessage and are described separately for each 
Submessage. 
submessageLength 
ushort 
Indicates the length of the Submessage. Given an RTPS 
Message consists of a concatenation of Submessages, the 
Submessage length can be used to skip to the next 
Submessage. 
The structure of the RTPS Submessage cannot be changed in this major version (2) of the protocol. 
 
SubmessageId 
The submessageId identifies the kind of Submessage. The valid ID’s are enumerated by the possible values of 
SubmessageKind (see Table 8.13). 
The meaning of the Submessage IDs cannot be modified in this major version (2). Additional Submessages can 
be added in higher minor versions. In order to maintain inter-operability with future versions, Platform Specific 
Mappings should reserve a range of values intended for protocol extensions and a range of values that are 
reserved for vendor-specific Submessages that will never be used by future versions of the RTPS protocol.

flags 
The flags in the Submessage header contain 8 boolean values. The first flag, the EndiannessFlag, is present and 
located in the same position in all Submessages and represents the endianness used to encode the information in 
the Submessage. The literal ‘E’ is often used to refer to the EndiannessFlag. 
If the EndiannessFlag is set to FALSE, the Submessage is encoded in big-endian format, EndiannessFlag set to 
TRUE means little-endian. 
Other flags have interpretations that depend on the type of Submessage. 
 
submessageLength 
Indicates the length of the Submessage (not including the Submessage header). In case submessageLength > 0, 
it is either: 
• 
The length from the start of the contents of the Submessage until the start of the header of the 
next Submessage (in case the Submessage is not the last Submessage in the Message). 
• 
Or else it is the remaining Message length (in case the Submessage is the last Submessage in 
the Message). An interpreter of the Message can distinguish between these two cases as it 
knows the total length of the Message. 
In case submessageLength==0, the Submessage is the last Submessage in the Message and extends up to the 
end of the Message. This makes it possible to send Submessages larger than 64k (the maximum length that can 
be stored in the submessageLength field), provided they are the last Submessage in the Message. 
8.3.4 
The RTPS Message Receiver 
The interpretation and meaning of a Submessage within a Message may depend on the previous Submessages 
contained within that same Message. Therefore, the receiver of a Message must maintain state from previously 
deserialized Submessages in the same Message. This state is modeled as the state of an RTPS Receiver that is 
reset each time a new message is processed and provides context for the interpretation of each Submessage. The 
RTPS Receiver is shown in Figure 8.12. Table 8.17 lists the attributes used to represent the state of the RTPS 
Receiver. 
 
Figure 8.12 - RTPS Receiver 
For each new Message, the state of the Receiver is reset and initialized as listed below.

Rules Followed by the Message Receiver 
The following algorithm outlines the rules that a receiver of any Message must follow: 
1. 
If the full Submessage header cannot be read, the rest of the Message is considered invalid. 
2. 
The submessageLength field defines where the next Submessage starts or indicates that the 
Submessage extends to the end of the Message, as explained in Section 8.3.3.3.3. If this field is 
invalid, the rest of the Message is invalid. 
3. 
A Submessage with an unknown SubmessageId must be ignored and parsing must continue 
with the next Submessage. Concretely: an implementation of RTPS 2.5 must ignore any 
Submessages with IDs that are outside of the SubmessageKind set defined in version 2.5. 
SubmessageIds in the vendor-specific range coming from a vendorId that is unknown must 
also be ignored and parsing must continue with the next Submessage.

## Page 44

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
38
4. 
Submessage flags. The receiver of a Submessage should ignore unknown flags. An 
implementation of RTPS 2.5 should skip all flags that are marked as “X” (unused) in the 
protocol. 
5. 
A valid submessageLength field must always be used to find the next Submessage, even for 
Submessages with known IDs. 
6. 
A known but invalid Submessage invalidates the rest of the Message. Sub clause 8.3.8 
describes each known. 
Submessage and when it should be considered invalid. Reception of a valid header and/or Submessage has two 
effects: 
1. It can change the state of the Receiver; this state influences how the following Submessages in 
the Message are interpreted. 8.3.8 discusses how the state changes for each Submessage. In this 
version of the protocol, only the Header and the Submessages HeaderExtension, InfoSource, 
InfoReply, InfoDestination, and InfoTimestamp change the state of the Receiver. 
2. It can affect the behavior of the Endpoint to which the message is destined. This applies to the 
basic RTPS messages: Data, DataFrag, HeartBeat, AckNack, Gap, HeartbeatFrag, NackFrag. 
Sub clause 8.3.8 describes the detailed interpretation of the Header and every Submessage. 
8.3.5 
RTPS SubmessageElements 
Each RTPS message contains a variable number of RTPS Submessages. Each RTPS Submessage in turn is built 
from a set of predefined atomic building blocks called SubmessageElements. RTPS 2.5 defines the submessage 
elements shown in Figure 8.13 below. 
  
Figure 8.13 - RTPS SubmessageElements 
8.3.5.1 
The GuidPrefix, and EntityId 
These SubmessageElements are used to contain the GuidPrefix_t and EntityId_t parts of a GUID_t (defined in 
8.2.4.1) within Submessages. 
Table 8.18 - Structure of the GuidPrefix SubmessageElement 
field 
type 
meaning

GuidPrefix_t 
Identifies the GuidPrefix_t part of the GUID_t of the Entity that is 
the source or target of the message.

EntityId_t 
Identifies the EntityId_t part of the GUID_t of the Entity that is the 
source or target of the message. 
8.3.5.2 
VendorId 
The VendorId identifies the vendor of the middleware implementing the RTPS protocol and allows this vendor 
to add specific extensions to the protocol. The vendor ID does not refer to the vendor of the device or product 
that contains DDS middleware. 
Table 8.20 – Structure of the VendorId SubmessageElement 
field 
type 
meaning 
value 
VendorId_t 
Identifies the vendor of the middleware that implements the protocol. 
The following values are reserved by the protocol: 
VENDORID_UNKNOWN 
Other values must be assigned by the OMG. 
8.3.5.3 
ProtocolVersion 
The ProtocolVersion defines the version of the RTPS protocol. 
Table 8.21 - Structure of the ProtocolVersion SubmessageElement 
field 
type 
meaning 
value 
ProtocolVersion_t 
Identifies the major and minor version of the RTPS protocol. 
The RTPS protocol version 2.5 defines the following special values:

PROTOCOLVERSION_2_0 
PROTOCOLVERSION_2_1 
PROTOCOLVERSION_2_2 
PROTOCOLVERSION_2_2 
PROTOCOLVERSION_2_4 
8.3.5.4 
SequenceNumber 
A sequence number is a 64-bit signed integer, that can take values in the range: -2^63 <= N <= 2^63-1. The 
selection of 64 bits as the representation of a sequence number ensures the sequence numbers never1 wrap. 
Sequence numbers begin at 1. 
Table 8.22 – Structure of the SequenceNumber SubmessageElements 
field 
type 
meaning 
value 
SequenceNumber_t 
Provides the value of the 64-bit sequence number. 
 
 
1 Even assuming an extremely fast rate of message generation for a single RTPS Writer such as 100 messages per 
microsecond, the 64-bit integer would not roll over for approximately 3000 years of uninterrupted operation.

The protocol reserves the following value: 
SEQUENCENUMBER_UNKNOWN 
8.3.5.5 
SequenceNumberSet 
SequenceNumberSet SubmessageElements are used as parts of several messages to provide binary information 
about individual sequence numbers within a range. The sequence numbers represented in the 
SequenceNumberSet are limited to belong to an interval with a range no bigger than 256. In other words, a 
valid SequenceNumberSet must verify that: 
maximum(SequenceNumberSet) - minimum(SequenceNumberSet) < 256 
minimum(SequenceNumberSet) >= 1 
The above restriction allows SequenceNumberSet to be represented in an efficient and compact way using 
bitmaps. 
SequenceNumberSet SubmessageElements are used for example to selectively request re-sending of a set of 
sequence numbers.

FragmentNumber 
A fragment number is a 32-bit unsigned integer and is used by Submessages to identify a particular fragment in 
fragmented serialized data. Fragment numbers start at 1.

FragmentNumberSet 
FragmentNumberSet SubmessageElements are used to provide binary information about individual fragment 
numbers within a range. The fragment numbers represented in the FragmentNumberSet are limited to belong 
to an interval with a range no bigger than 256. In other words, a valid FragmentNumberSet must verify that: 
maximum(FragmentNumberSet) - minimum(FragmentNumberSet) < 256

ParameterList 
ParameterList is used as part of several messages to contain parameters that may affect the interpretation of the 
message. The representation of the parameters follows a mechanism that allows extensions without breaking 
backwards compatibility.

The actual representation of the ParameterList is defined for each PSM. However, in order to support inter-
operability or bridging between PSMs and allow for extensions that preserve backwards compatibility, the 
representation used by all PSMs must comply with the following rules: 
• There shall be no more than 2^16 possible values of the ParameterId_t parameterId. 
• A range of 2^15 values is reserved for protocol-defined parameters. All the parameter_id values 
defined by the 2.5 version of the protocol and all future revisions of the same major version must 
use values in this range. 
• A range of 2^15 values is reserved for vendor-defined parameters. The 2.5 version of the protocol 
and any future revisions of the protocol that correspond to the same major version are not 
allowed to use values in this range. 
• The maximum length of any parameter is limited to 2^16 octets. 
Subject to the above constraints, different PSMs might choose different representations for the ParameterId_t. 
For example, a PSM could represent parameterId using short integers while another PSM may use strings. 
8.3.5.10 Count 
Count is used by several Submessages and enables a receiver to detect duplicates of the same Submessage.

8.3.5.12 Checksum 
Checksum is used in the HeaderExtension Submessage and enables the receiver to detect messages corrupted 
by the underlying transport. 
Depending on the underlying transport used to send the RTPS message, the transport may already provide 
sufficient guarantee that messages are not corrupted. In these cases, the Checksum may be omitted from the 
HeaderExtension.  The specific behavior shall be defined for each Transport PSM.

MessageLength is used in the HeaderExtension Submessage and enables the sender to indicate the length of 
the RTPS message. 
Depending on the underlying transport used to send the RTPS message, the length of the RTPS message may 
already or be derivable from the information in the transport header. In these cases, the MessageLength may be 
omitted from the HeaderExtension.  The specific behavior shall be defined for each Transport PSM.

8.3.5.14 UExtension4 
UExtension4 is used in the HeaderExtension Submessage and enables the sender to add 4 octets of 
information to the header. This version of the specification does not interpret these bytes. It is intended to 
support future extensions of the RTPS specification.

8.3.6 
The RTPS Header 
As described in 8.3.3, every RTPS Message must start with a Header. 
8.3.6.1 
Purpose 
The Header is used to identify the message as belonging to the RTPS protocol, to identify the version of the 
RTPS protocol used, and to provide context information that applies to the Submessages contained within the 
message. 
8.3.6.2 
Content 
The elements that form the structure of the Header were described in 8.3.3.1. The structure of the Header can 
only be changed if the major version of the protocol is also changed. 
8.3.6.3 
Validity 
A Header is invalid when any of the following are true: 
• The Message has less than the required number of octets to contain a full Header. The number 
required is defined by the PSM. 
• Its protocol value does not match the value of PROTOCOL_RTPS2. 
• The major protocol version is larger than the major protocol version supported by the 
implementation. 
8.3.6.4 
Change in state of Receiver 
The initial state of the Receiver is described in 8.3.4. This sub clause describes how the Header of a new 
Message affects the state of the Receiver.

8.3.7 
The RTPS HeaderExtension 
8.3.7.1 
Purpose 
The HeaderExtension is used to convey optional information about the RTPS Message. This submessage, 
if present, shall appear immediately after the RTPS Header. 
8.3.7.2 
Content 
The elements that form the structure of the HeaderExtension were described in 8.3.3.2. 
 
2 The actual value of the PROTOCOL_RTPS constant is provided by the PSM.

## Page 51

8.3.7.3 
Validity 
This HeaderExtension is invalid when any of the following is true: 
• 
The submessage is present but does not immediately follow the RTPS Header. 
• 
The submessageLength in the Submessage header is too small to fit the fields that are present as 
indicated by the submessage flags. 
• 
The messageLength is too small to fit the RTPS Header and the HeaderExtension. 
• 
The parameters are malformed. 
8.3.7.4 
Change in state of Receiver 
The state of the Receiver changes is certain fields are present in the HeaderExtension as indicated 
below: 
IF ( LengthFlag ) { 
    Receiver.messageLength   = HeaderExtension.messageLength 
} 
 
IF ( TimestampFlag ) { 
    Receiver.rtpsSendTimestamp = HeaderExtension.rtpsSendTimestamp 
    Receiver.rtpsReceptionTimestamp = GetCurrentTime() 
    RECEIVER.clockSkewDetected =  
        CLOCK_SKEW_DETECTED(receptionTime, Receiver.rtpsSendTimestamp) 
} 
 
IF ( uExtensionFlag ) { 
    Receiver.uExtension4 = HeaderExtension.uExtension4 
} 
IF ( wExtensionFlag ) { 
    Receiver.wExtension8 = HeaderExtension.wExtension8 
} 
IF ( ChecksumFlags != 00 ) { 
    Receiver.messageChecksum = HeaderExtension.messageChecksum 
} 
IF ( ParamatersFlag) { 
    Receiver.parameters = HeaderExtension.parameters 
} 
 
8.3.7.5 
Logical Interpretation 
The HeaderExtension may be sent to communicate the length of the RTPS Message, the time when the 
message was sent, a checksum of the RTPS Message, or additional information about the RTPS message. 
The messageLength may be useful for managing memory while receiving incoming RTPS messages. The value 
of the messageLength shall indicate the length of the entire RTPS Message starting from the beginning of the 
RTPS Header. 
The rtpsSendTimestamp represents the time the RTPS message was sent.  It is measured using the clock of the 
sending Participant. 
The rtpsReceptionTimestamp represents the time when the RTPS message was received. It is measured using 
the clock of the receiving Participant. 
 
The function CLOCK_SKEW_DETECTED() represents an implementation-specific function used to determine 
whether the sending and receiving participant clocks are not synchronized or have too large a skew. The criteria

## Page 52

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
46
used is implementation-specific, but it could be as simple as detecting a message delay that exceeds a pre-
configured threshold. 
The value of clockSkewDetected represents whether clock skew was detected for this RTPS message. This can 
be used to correct the source timestamps associated with the DATA messages. See 8.3.8.11.5 
The uExtension4 and wExtension8 may be useful to communicate additional data on the header in a future 
version of the RTPS specification. 
The messageChecksum may be useful to detect message corruption by the underlying transport. It shall be 
computed over the entire RTPS Message. For the purpose of computing the checksum, the value of the 
messageChecksum field in the RTPS HeaderExtension shall be set to zero. 
The parameters contain additional information about the RTPS Message. This is intended for future 
extensibility and vendor extensions. This version of the specification does not define any parameters in the 
HeaderExtension. 
8.3.8 
RTPS Submessages 
The RTPS protocol version 2.5 defines several kinds of Submessages. They are categorized into two groups: 
Entity- Submessages and Interpreter-Submessages. Entity Submessages target an RTPS Entity. Interpreter 
Submessages modify the RTPS Receiver state and provide context that helps process subsequent Entity 
Submessages. 
The Entity Submessages are: 
• 
Data: Contains information regarding the value of an application Date-object. Data 
Submessages are sent by Writers to Readers. 
• 
DataFrag: Equivalent to Data, but only contains a part of the new value (one or more 
fragments). Allows data to be transmitted as multiple fragments to overcome transport message 
size limitations. 
• 
Heartbeat: Describes the information that is available in a Writer. Heartbeat messages are 
sent by a Writer to one or more Readers. 
• 
HeartbeatFrag: For fragmented data, describes what fragments are available in a Writer. 
HeartbeatFrag messages are sent by a Writer to one or more Readers. 
• 
Gap: Describes the information that is no longer relevant to Readers. Gap messages are sent by 
a Writer to one or more Readers. 
• 
AckNack: Provides information on the state of a Reader to a Writer. AckNack messages are 
sent by a Reader to one or more Writers. 
• 
NackFrag: Provides information on the state of a Reader to a Writer, more specifically what 
fragments the Reader is still missing. NackFrag messages are sent by a Reader to one or more 
Writers. 
The Interpreter Submessages are: 
• 
HeaderExtension: Provides additional information that logically belongs in the RTPS Header. 
The additional information is included inside this submessage, instead of the HTPS Header, in 
order to preserve interoperability with earlier versions of the RTPS protocol. RTPS version 2.4 
and earlier version are not able to process the HeaderExtension and will skip this submessage.  
• 
InfoSource: Provides information about the source from which subsequent Entity Submessages 
originated. This Submessage is primarily used for relaying RTPS Submessages. This is not 
discussed in the current specification. 
• 
InfoDestination: Provides information about the final destination of subsequent Entity 
Submessages. This Submessage is primarily used for relaying RTPS Submessages. This is not 
discussed in the current specification. 
• 
InfoReply: Provides information about where to reply to the entities that appear in subsequent 
Submessages.

## Page 53

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
47 
 
 
• 
InfoTimestamp: Provides a source timestamp for subsequent Entity Submessages. 
• 
Pad: Used to add padding to a Message if needed for memory alignment.

The Reader sends the AckNack message to the Writer to communicate its state with respect to the sequence 
numbers used by the Writer. 
The Writer is uniquely identified by its GUID. The Writer GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
writerGUID = { Receiver.destGuidPrefix, AckNack.writerId }

The Reader is uniquely identified by its GUID. The Reader GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
readerGUID = { Receiver.sourceGuidPrefix, AckNack.readerId } 
The message serves two purposes simultaneously: 
• 
The Submessage acknowledges all sequence numbers up to and including the one just before the 
lowest sequence number in the SequenceNumberSet (that is readerSNState.base -1). 
• 
The Submessage negatively-acknowledges (requests) the sequence numbers that appear 
explicitly in the set. 
The mechanism to explicitly represent sequence numbers depends on the PSM. Typically, a compact 
representation (such as a bitmap) is used. 
The FinalFlag indicates whether a Heartbeat by the Writer is expected by the Reader or if the decision is 
left to the Writer. The use of this flag is described in Section 8.4. 
8.3.8.2 
Data 
This Submessage is sent from an RTPS Writer to an RTPS Reader. 
 
Purpose 
The Submessage notifies the RTPS Reader of a change to a data-object belonging to the RTPS Writer. The 
possible changes include both changes in value as well as changes to the lifecycle of the data-object.

writerSN 
SequenceNumber Uniquely identifies the change and the relative order for all 
changes made by the RTPS Writer identified by the writerGuid. 
Each change gets a consecutive sequence number. Each RTPS 
Writer maintains is own sequence number.

SerializedPayload Present only if either the DataFlag or the KeyFlag are set in the 
header. 
If the DataFlag is set, then it contains the new value of the data-
object after the change. 
If the KeyFlag is set, then it contains the key of the data-object the 
message refers to. 
 
Validity 
This Submessage is invalid when any of the following is true: 
• 
submessageLength in the Submessage header is too small. 
• 
writerSN.value is not strictly positive (1, 2, ...) or is SEQUENCENUMBER_UNKNOWN. 
• 
inlineQos is invalid. 
 
Change in state of Receiver 
None 
 
Logical Interpretation 
The RTPS Writer sends the Data Submessage to the RTPS Reader to communicate changes to the data-
objects within the writer. Changes include both changes in value as well as changes to the lifecycle of the data-
object. 
Changes to the value are communicated by the presence of the serializedPayload. When present, the 
serializedPayload is interpreted either as the value of the data-object or as the key that uniquely identifies the 
data-object from the set of registered objects. 
• 
If the DataFlag is set and the KeyFlag is not set, the serializedPayload element is interpreted as 
the value of the data-object. 
• 
If the KeyFlag is set and the DataFlag is not set, the serializedPayload element is interpreted as 
the value of the key that identifies the registered instance of the data-object. 
If the InlineQosFlag is set, the inlineQos element contains QoS values that override those of the RTPS Writer 
and should be used to process the update. For a complete list of possible in-line QoS parameters, see Table 
8.85. 
If the NonStandardPayloadFlag is set then the serializedPayload element is not formatted according to Section 
10. This flag is informational. It indicates that the SerializedPayload has been transformed as described in 
another specification. For example, this flag should be set when the SerializedPayload is transformed as 
described in the DDS-Security specification. 
The Writer is uniquely identified by its GUID. The Writer GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
writerGUID = { Receiver.sourceGuidPrefix, Data.writerId } 
The Reader is uniquely identified by its GUID. The Reader GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
readerGUID = { Receiver.destGuidPrefix, Data.readerId } 
The Data.readerId can be ENTITYID_UNKNOWN, in which case the Data applies to all Readers of that 
writerGUID within the Participant identified by the GuidPrefix_t Receiver.destGuidPrefix.

8.3.8.3 
DataFrag 
This Submessage is sent from an RTPS Writer to an RTPS Reader. 
 
Purpose 
The DataFrag Submessage extends the Data Submessage by enabling the serializedData to be fragmented 
and sent as multiple DataFrag Submessages. The fragments contained in the DataFrag Submessages are 
then re-assembled by the RTPS Reader. 
Defining a separate DataFrag Submessage in addition to the Data Submessage, offers the following 
advantages: 
• 
It keeps variations in contents and structure of each Submessage to a minimum. This enables 
more efficient implementations of the protocol as the parsing of network packets is simplified. 
• 
It avoids having to add fragmentation information as in-line QoS parameters in the Data 
Submessage. This may not only slow down performance, it also makes on-the-wire debugging 
more difficult, as it is no longer obvious whether data is fragmented or not and which message 
contains what fragment(s).

fragment size equals 64K. 
inlineQos 
ParameterList 
Present only if the InlineQosFlag is set in the header. 
Contains QoS that may affect the interpretation of the message. 
serializedPayload 
SerializedPayload A consecutive series of fragments, starting at 
fragmentStartingNum for a total of fragmentsInSubmessage. 
Represents part of the new value of the data-object after the 
change. 
• If the KeyFlag is not set, then it contains a 
consecutive set of fragments of the new value of the 
data- object after the change. 
• If the KeyFlag is set, then it contains a consecutive 
set of fragments of the key of the data-object the 
message refers to. 
In either case the consecutive set of fragments contains 
fragmentsInSubmessage fragments and starts with the fragment 
identified by fragmentStartingNum. 
 
Validity 
This Submessage is invalid when any of the following is true: 
• 
submessageLength in the Submessage header is too small. 
• 
writerSN.value is not strictly positive (1, 2, ...) or is SEQUENCENUMBER_UNKNOWN. 
• 
fragmentStartingNum.value is not strictly positive (1, 2, ...) or exceeds the total number of 
fragments (see below). 
• 
fragmentSize exceeds dataSize. 
• 
The size of serializedData exceeds fragmentsInSubmessage * fragmentSize. 
• 
inlineQos is invalid. 
 
Change in state of Receiver 
None 
 
Logical Interpretation 
The DataFrag Submessage extends the Data Submessage by enabling the serializedData to be fragmented 
and sent as multiple DataFrag Submessages. Once the serializedData is re-assembled by the RTPS Reader, 
the interpretation of the DataFrag Submessages is identical to that of the Data Submessage. 
How to re-assemble serializedData using the information in the DataFrag Submessage is described below. 
The total size of the data to be re-assembled is given by dataSize. Each DataFrag Submessage contains a 
contiguous segment of this data in its serializedData element. The size of the segment is determined by the size 
of the serializedData element. During re-assembly, the offset of each segment is determined by: 
(fragmentStartingNum - 1) * fragmentSize

## Page 59

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
53 
 
 
The data is fully re-assembled when all fragments have been received. The total number of fragments to expect 
equals: 
(dataSize / fragmentSize) + ((dataSize % fragmentSize) ? 1 : 0) 
Note that each DataFrag Submessage may contain multiple fragments. An RTPS Writer will select 
fragmentSize based on the smallest message size supported across all underlying transports. If some RTPS 
Readers can be reached across a transport that supports larger messages, the RTPS Writer can pack multiple 
fragments into a single DataFrag Submessage or may even send a regular Data Submessage if 
fragmentation is no longer required. For more details, see 8.4.14.1. 
When sending inlineQos with DataFrag Submessages, it is only required to send the inlineQos with the first 
DataFrag Submessage for a given Writer sequence number. Sending the same inlineQos with every 
DataFrag Submessage for a given Writer sequence number is redundant. 
8.3.8.4 
Gap 
 
Purpose 
This Submessage is sent from an RTPS Writer to an RTPS Reader and indicates to the RTPS Reader that a set 
of changes in the RTPS Writer HistoryCache are not available to one or more RTPS Reader endpoints and will 
not be sent to them. The changes are identified by their corresponding sequence numbers. The set may contain a 
contiguous range of sequence numbers as well as a list  of sequence numbers beyond the range.  
In addition, the Gap message may also inform the RTPS Reader of the number of changes in the Gap 
representing changes filtered for that RTPS Reader.  These “filtered changes” are changes still present in the 
Writer HistoryCache that will not be sent to the RTPS Reader due to the application of a filtering criteria by the 
Writer. Examples of filtering criteria include: 
• 
A content filter specified by the RTPS Reader. 
• 
A time filter specified by the RTPS Reader. 
• 
A writer-side specification that the sample is written directed to a specific set of RTPS Reader 
endpoints that do not include the RTPS Reader that receives the Gap. 
Filtered changes should not be treated as samples lost by the RTPS Reader.

numbers corresponding to the set of not-available changes. 
gapList 
SequenceNumberSet 
Serves two purposes: 
(1) Identifies the last sequence number in the interval 
of sequence numbers corresponding to the set of not-
available changes. 
(2) Identifies an additional list of sequence numbers 
corresponding to not-available changes. 
gapStartGSN 
SequenceNumber

Identifies the group sequence number corresponding to the 
sample identified by gapStart. 
gapEndGSN 
SequenceNumber 
Present only if the GroupInfoFlag is set in the header. 
Identifies the end of a continuous range of GSNs starting at 
gapStartGSN that are not available to the Reader.  
It shall be greater than or equal to the group sequence number 
corresponding to the sample identified by gapList.bitmapBase. 
filteredCount

Indicates the number of changes corresponding to the set of 
sequence numbers in the Gap that are still present in the Writer 
cache but are being filtered for the RTPS Reader. 
 
Validity 
This Submessage is invalid when any of the following is true: 
• 
submessageLength in the Submessage header is too small. 
• 
gapStart is zero or negative. 
• 
gapList is invalid (as defined in 8.3.5.5). 
If GroupInfoFlag is set and: 
• 
gapStartGSN.value is zero or negative 
• 
gapEndGSN.value is zero or negative 
• 
gapEndGSN.value < gapStartGSN.value-1 
 
Change in state of Receiver 
None 
 
Logical Interpretation 
The RTPS Writer sends the Gap message to the RTPS Reader to communicate that certain changes are not 
available to the Reader. This is typically caused by Writer-side filtering of the sample (content-filtered topics, 
time-based filtering) as well as samples being replaced with new samples in a Writer with HISTORY Qos 
KEEP_LAST.  
The set of sequence numbers that identify the corresponding changes appear in the Gap message divided in two 
groups: 
1. All sequence numbers in the range gapStart <= sequence_number <= gapList.base -1 
2. All the sequence numbers that appear explicitly listed in the gapList.

## Page 61

DDSI-RTPS v2.5

This set will be referred to as the Gap::sequence_number_set. 
The Writer is uniquely identified by its GUID. The Writer GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
writerGUID = { Receiver.sourceGuidPrefix, Gap.writerId } 
The Reader is uniquely identified by its GUID. The Reader GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
readerGUID = { Receiver.destGuidPrefix, Gap.readerId } 
The Gap readerId can be ENTITYID_UNKNOWN, in which case the Gap applies to all Readers of that 
writerGUID within the Participant. 
The Writer sets the GroupInfoFlag to indicate the presence of the gapStartGSN and gapEndGSN elements. 
These fields provide information related to the CacheChanges of Writers belonging to a Writer Group. See 
section 8.7.6 for how DDS uses this feature. 
The gapEndGSN can extend past the Group Sequence Number that corresponds to gapList.bitmapBase in 
situations where those additional Group Sequence Numbers have been written by other Writers.  
The filteredCount is the count of the sequence numbers in the Gap::sequence_number_set that correspond 
to changes that are still in the RTPS Writer HistoryCache but the Writer will not send as they are considered 
not relevant to the Reader  receiving the Gap. This means the Reader would not have been interested in them 
because they do not meet some reader-specified criteria or because they were written exclusively targeting other 
Reader endpoints. 
The filteredCount, if present, shall include: 
• 
Changes filtered due to the writer-side application of a content-filtered-topic specified by the Reader. 
• 
Changes filtered due to the writer-side application a time filter specified by the Reader. 
• 
Changes that are written in ways that intend to exclude delivery to the Reader. 
• 
Changes that are referenced in a Gap as non-relevant for a Reader may still be in the Writer 
HistoryCache. They may be relevant to other Readers (e.g. a reader without a content filter).  
The filteredCount shall not include changes that are no longer in the RTPS Writer HistoryCache unless the 
RTPS Writer knows that the sample would have been filtered for the Reader even if it was still in the cache. In 
particular, the filteredCount does not include changes that correspond to samples replaced by HISTORY Qos set 
to KEEP_LAST as well as samples removed from the Writer cache due to hitting any resource limit.

The following examples illustrate how the firstSN.value and lastSN.value are assigned in various scenarios. 
Example 1. A Writer that has never written any samples before sending a Heartbeat will send a 
Heartbeat with firstSN.value = 1, lastSN.value = 0. 
Example 2. A Writer that has only one sample in its cache with sequence number SN will send a Heartbeat 
with firstSN.value = lastSN.value = SN. 
Example 3. A Writer that has written 10 samples and still has the last 5 samples in its cache will send a 
Heartbeat with firstSN.value = 6, lastSN.value = 10. 
Example 4. A Writer that has written 10 samples before sending a Heartbeat but does not have any samples 
available at the time of the Heartbeat will send a Heartbeat with firstSN.value = 11, lastSN.value = 10. 
 
Validity 
This Submessage is invalid when any of the following is true: 
• 
submessageLength in the Submessage header is too small 
• 
firstSN.value is zero or negative 
• 
lastSN.value is negative 
• 
lastSN.value < firstSN.value - 1

• 
lastGSN.value is negative 
•

• 
currentGSN.value < firstGSN.value 
• 
currentGSN.value > lastGSN.value 
 
Change in state of Receiver 
None 
 
Logical Interpretation 
The Heartbeat message serves two purposes: 
1. It informs the Reader of the sequence numbers that are available in the writer’s HistoryCache so 
that the Reader may request (using an AckNack) any that it has missed. 
2. It requests the Reader to send an acknowledgement for the CacheChange changes that have 
been entered into the reader’s HistoryCache such that the Writer knows the state of the reader. 
All Heartbeat messages serve the first purpose. That is, the Reader will always find out the state of the 
writer’s HistoryCache and may request what it has missed. Normally, the RTPS Reader would only send an 
AckNack message if it is missing a CacheChange. 
The Writer uses the FinalFlag to request the Reader to send an acknowledgment for the sequence numbers it 
has received. If the Heartbeat has the FinalFlag set, then the Reader is not required to send an AckNack 
message back. However, if the FinalFlag is not set, then the Reader must send an AckNack message 
indicating which CacheChange changes it has received, even if the AckNack indicates it has received all 
CacheChange changes in the writer’s HistoryCache. 
The Writer sets the LivelinessFlag to indicate that the DDS DataWriter associated with the RTPS Writer of the 
message has manually asserted its liveliness using the appropriate DDS operation (see the DDS Specification). 
The RTPS Reader should therefore renew the manual liveliness lease of the corresponding remote DDS 
DataWriter.

## Page 64

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
58
The Writer sets the GroupInfoFlag to indicate the presence of the currentGSN, firstGSN, lastGSN, writerSet, 
and secureWriterSet elements. These fields provide relate the CacheChanges of Writers belonging to a Writer 
Group. See 8.7.6 for how DDS uses this feature. 
The Writer is identified uniquely by its GUID. The Writer GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
writerGUID = { Receiver.sourceGuidPrefix, Heartbeat.writerId } 
The Reader is identified uniquely by its GUID. The Reader GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
readerGUID = { Receiver.destGuidPrefix, Heartbeat.readerId } 
The Heartbeat.readerId can be ENTITYID_UNKNOWN, in which case the Heartbeat applies to all 
Readers of that writerGUID within the Participant. 
 
8.3.8.7 
HeartbeatFrag 
 
Purpose 
When fragmenting data and until all fragments are available, the HeartbeatFrag Submessage is sent from 
an RTPS Writer to an RTPS Reader to communicate which fragments the Writer has available. This enables 
reliable communication at the fragment level. 
Once all fragments are available, a regular Heartbeat message is used. 
 
Content

Count 
A counter that is incremented each time a new HeartbeatFrag 
message is sent. Provides the means for a Reader to detect 
duplicate HeartbeatFrag messages that can result from the 
presence of redundant communication paths. 
 
Validity 
This Submessage is invalid when any of the following is true: 
• 
submessageLength in the Submessage header is too small 
• 
writerSN.value is zero or negative 
• 
lastFragmentNum.value is zero or negative

Logical Interpretation 
The HeartbeatFrag message serves the same purpose as a regular Heartbeat message, but instead of 
indicating the availability of a range of sequence numbers, it indicates the availability of a range of fragments 
for the data change with sequence number WriterSN. 
The RTPS Reader will respond by sending a NackFrag message, but only if it is missing any of the available 
fragments. The Writer is identified uniquely by its GUID. The Writer GUID is obtained using the state of the  
Receiver: 
writerGUID = { Receiver.sourceGuidPrefix, HeartbeatFrag.writerId } 
The Reader is identified uniquely by its GUID. The Reader GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
readerGUID = { Receiver.destGuidPrefix, HeartbeatFrag.readerId } 
The HeartbeatFrag.readerId can be ENTITYID_UNKNOWN, in which case the HeartbeatFrag applies to 
all Readers of that Writer GUID within the Participant.

adjusted to account for clock skew between the sending and the receiving Participants. 
8.3.8.12 NackFrag 
 Purpose 
The NackFrag Submessage is used to communicate the state of a Reader to a Writer. When a data change is 
sent as a series of fragments, the NackFrag Submessage allows the Reader to inform the Writer about 
specific fragment numbers it is still missing. 
This Submessage can only contain negative acknowledgements. Note this differs from an AckNack 
Submessage, which includes both positive and negative acknowledgements. The advantages of this approach 
include: 
• 
It removes the windowing limitation introduced by the AckNack Submessage. Given the size of 
a SequenceNumberSet is limited to 256, an AckNack Submessage is limited to NACKing only 
those samples whose sequence number does not not exceed that of the first missing sample by 
more than 256. Any samples below the first missing samples are acknowledged. NackFrag 
Submessages on the other hand can be used to NACK any fragment numbers, even fragments 
more than 256 apart from those NACKed in an earlier AckNack Submessage. This becomes 
important when handling samples containing a large number of fragments. 
• 
Fragments can be negatively acknowledged in any order. 
 Content 
The elements that form the structure of the NackFrag message are described in the table below.

Count 
A counter that is incremented each time a new NackFrag

Provides the means for a Writer to detect duplicate 
NackFrag messages that can result from the presence of 
redundant communication paths. 
 Validity 
This Submessage is invalid when any of the following is true: 
• 
submessageLength in the Submessage header is too small. 
• 
writerSN.value is zero or negative. 
fragmentNumberState is invalid (as defined in 8.3.5.7). 
 Change in state of Receiver 
None 
 Logical Interpretation 
The Reader sends the NackFrag message to the Writer to request fragments from the Writer. 
The Writer is uniquely identified by its GUID. The Writer GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
writerGUID = { Receiver.destGuidPrefix, NackFrag.writerId } 
The Reader is identified uniquely by its GUID. The Reader GUID is obtained using the state of the Receiver: 
readerGUID = { Receiver.sourceGuidPrefix, NackFrag.readerId } 
The sequence number from which fragments are requested is given by writerSN. The mechanism to explicitly 
represent fragment numbers depends on the PSM. Typically, a compact representation (such as a bitmap) is 
used. 
8.3.8.13 Pad 
 Purpose 
The purpose of this Submessage is to allow the introduction of any padding necessary to meet any desired 
memory- alignment requirements. It has no other meaning. 
 Content 
This Submessage has no contents. It accomplishes its purposes with only the Submessage header part. The 
amount of padding is determined by the value of submessageLength. 
 Validity 
This Submessage is always valid.

Behavior Module 
This module describes the dynamic behavior of the RTPS entities. It describes the valid sequences of message 
exchanges between RTPS Writer endpoints and RTPS Reader endpoints and the timing constraints of those 
messages. 
8.4.1 
Overview 
Once an RTPS Writer has been matched with an RTPS Reader, they are both responsible for ensuring that 
CacheChange changes that exist in the Writer’s HistoryCache are propagated to the Reader’s HistoryCache. 
The Behavior Module describes how the matching RTPS Writer and Reader pair must behave in order to 
propagate CacheChange changes. The behavior is defined in terms of message exchanges using the RTPS 
Messages defined in 8.3. The Behavior Module is organized as follows: 
• 
8.4.2 lists what requirements all implementations of the RTPS protocol must satisfy in terms of 
behavior. An implementation that satisfies these requirements is considered compliant and will be 
interoperable with other compliant implementations. 
• 
As implied above, it is possible for multiple implementations to satisfy the minimum 
requirements, where each implementation may choose a different trade-off between memory 
requirements, bandwidth usage, scalability, and efficiency. The RTPS specification does not 
mandate a single implementation with corresponding behavior. Instead, it defines the minimum 
requirements for interoperability and then provides two Reference Implementations, the 
Stateless and Stateful Reference Implementations, described in 8.4.3. 
• 
The protocol behavior depends on such settings as the RELIABILITY QoS. 8.4.4 discusses the 
possible combinations. 
• 
8.4.5 and 8.4.6 define notational conventions and define any new types used in this module. 
• 
8.4.7 through 8.4.12 model the two Reference Implementations. 
• 
8.4.13 describes the Writer Liveliness Protocol that is used by Participants to assert the 
liveliness of their contained Writers. 
• 
8.4.14 discusses some optional behavior, including support for fragmented data. 
• 
Finally, 8.4.15 provides guidelines for actual implementations. 
Note that, as discussed earlier in 8.2.10, the Behavior Module does not model the interactions between DDS 
Entities and their corresponding RTPS entities. For example, it simply assumes a DDS DataWriter adds and 
removes CacheChange changes to and from its RTPS Writer’s HistoryCache. Changes are added by the DDS 
DataWriter as part of its write operation and removed when no longer needed. It is important to realize the DDS 
DataWriter may remove a CacheChange before it has been propagated to one or more of the matched RTPS 
Reader endpoints. The RTPS Writer is not in control of when a CacheChange is removed from the Writer’s 
HistoryCache. It is the responsibility of the DDS DataWriter to only remove those CacheChange changes that 
can be removed based on the communication status and the DDS DataWriter’s QoS. For example, the 
HISTORY QoS setting of KEEP_LAST with a depth of 1 allows a DataWriter to remove a CacheChange if a 
more recent change replaces the value of the same data-object. 
8.4.1.1 
Example Behavior 
The contents of this sub clause are not part of the formal specification of the protocol. The purpose of this sub 
clause is to provide an intuitive understanding of the protocol.

## Page 71

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
65 
 
 
A typical sequence illustrating the exchanges between an RTPS Writer and a matched RTPS Reader is shown 
in Figure 8.15. The example sequence in this case uses the Stateful Reference Implementation. 
 
Figure 8.15 – Example Behavior 
The individual interactions are described below: 
1. The DDS user writes data by invoking the write operation on the DDS DataWriter. 
2. The DDS DataWriter invokes the new_change operation on the RTPS Writer to create a new 
CacheChange. Each CacheChange is identified uniquely by a SequenceNumber. 
3. The new_change operation returns. 
4. The DDS DataWriter uses the add_change operation to store the CacheChange into the RTPS 
Writer’s HistoryCache. 
5. The add_change operation returns. 
6. The write operation returns, the user has completed the action of writing Data. 
7. The RTPS Writer sends the contents of the CacheChange changes to the RTPS Reader using 
the Data Submessage and requests an acknowledgment by also sending a Heartbeat 
Submessage. 
8. The RTPS Reader receives the Data message and, assuming that the resource limits allow 
that, places the CacheChange into the reader’s HistoryCache using the add_change operation. 
9. The add_change operation returns. The CacheChange is visible to the DDS DataReader and the 
DDS user. The conditions for this depend on the reliabilityLevel attribute of the RTPS Reader. 
a. For a RELIABLE DDS DataReader, changes in its RTPS Reader’s HistoryCache are made 
visible to the user application only when all previous changes (i.e., changes with smaller 
sequence numbers) are also visible. 
b. For a BEST_EFFORT DDS DataReader, changes in its RTPS Reader’s HistoryCache are 
made visible to the user only if no future changes have already been made visible (i.e., if

## Page 72

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
66
there are no changes in the RTPS Receiver’s HistoryCache with a higher sequence 
number). 
10. The DDS user is notified by one of the mechanisms described in the DDS Specification (e.g., 
by means of a listener or a WaitSet) and initiates reading of the data by calling the take 
operation on the DDS DataReader. 
11. The DDS DataReader accesses the change using the get_change operation on the 
HistoryCache. 
12. The get_change operation returns the CacheChange to the DataReader. 
13. The take operation returns the data to the DDS user. 
14. The RTPS Reader sends an AckNack message indicating that the CacheChange was placed 
into the Reader’s HistoryCache. The AckNack message contains the GUID of the RTPS 
Reader and the SequenceNumber of the change. This action is independent from the 
notification to the DDS user and the reading of the data by the DDS user. It could have occurred 
before or concurrently with that. 
15. The StatefulWriter records that the RTPS Reader has received the CacheChange and adds it to 
the set of acked_changes maintained by the ReaderProxy using the acked_changes_set 
operation. 
16. The DDS user invokes the return_loan operation on the DataReader to indicate that it is no 
longer using the data it retrieved by means of the previous take operation. This action is 
independent from the actions on the writer side as it is initiated by the DDS user. 
17. The DDS DataReader uses the remove_change operation to remove the data from the 
HistoryCache. 
18. The remove_change operation returns. 
19. The return_loan operation returns. 
20. The DDS DataWriter uses the operation is_acked_by_all to determine which CacheChanges 
have been received by all the RTPS Reader endpoints matched with the StatefulWriter. 
21. The is_acked_by_all returns and indicates that the change with the specified ‘seq_num’ 
SequenceNumber has been acknowledged by all RTPS Reader endpoints. 
22. The DDS DataWriter uses the operation remove_change to remove the change associated with 
‘seq_num’ from the RTPS Writer’s HistoryCache. In doing this, the DDS DataWriter also 
takes into account other DDS QoS such as DURABILITY. 
23. The operation remove_change returns. 
The description above did not model some of the interactions between the DDS DataReader and the RTPS 
Reader; for example, the mechanism used by the RTPS Reader to alert to the DataReader that it should call read 
or take to check whether new changes have been received (i.e., what causes step 10 to be taken). 
Also unmodeled are some interactions between the DDS DataWriter and the RTPS Writer; such as the 
mechanism used by the RTPS Writer to alert to the DataWriter that it should check whether a particular change 
has been fully acknowledged such that it can be removed from the HistoryCache (i.e., what causes step 20 
above to be initiated). 
The aforementioned interactions are not modeled because they are internal to the implementation of the 
middleware and have no effect on the RTPS protocol. 
8.4.2 
Behavior Required for Interoperability 
This sub clause describes the requirements that all implementations of the RTPS protocol must satisfy in order 
to be: 
• compliant with the protocol specification 
• interoperable with other implementations

## Page 73

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
67 
 
 
The scope of these requirements is limited to message exchanges between RTPS implementations by different 
vendors. For message exchanges between implementations by the same vendor, vendors may opt for a non-
compliant implementation or may use a proprietary protocol instead. 
8.4.2.1 
General Requirements 
The following requirements apply to all RTPS Entities. 
 
All communications must take place using RTPS Messages 
No other messages can be used than the RTPS Messages defined in 8.3. The required contents, validity and 
interpretation of each Message is defined by the RTPS specification. 
Vendors may extend Messages for vendor specific needs using the extension mechanisms provided by the 
protocol (see 8.6). This does not affect interoperability. 
 
All implementations must implement the RTPS Message Receiver 
Implementations must implement the rules followed by the RTPS Message Receiver, as introduced in 8.3.4, to 
interpret Submessages within the RTPS Message and maintain the state of the Message Receiver. 
This requirement also includes proper Message formatting by preceding Entity Submessages with 
Interpreter Submessages when required for proper interpretation of the former, as defined in 8.3.8. 
 
The timing characteristics of all implementations must be tunable 
Depending on the application requirements, deployment configuration and underlying transports, the end-user 
may want to tune the timing characteristics of the RTPS protocol. 
Therefore, where the requirements on the protocol behavior allow delayed responses or specify periodic events, 
implementations must allow the end-user to tune those timing characteristics. 
 
Implementations must implement the Simple Participant and Endpoint Discovery Protocols 
Implementations must implement the Simple Participant and Endpoint Discovery Protocols to enable the 
discovery of remote Endpoints (see 8.5). 
RTPS allows the use of different Participant and Endpoint Discovery Protocols, depending on the deployment 
needs of the application. For the purpose of interoperability, implementations must implement at least the 
Simple Participant Discovery Protocol and Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol (see 8.5.1). 
8.4.2.2 
Required RTPS Writer Behavior 
The following requirements apply to RTPS Writers only. Unless indicated, the requirements apply to both 
reliable and best-effort Writers. 
 
Writers must not send data out-of-order 
A Writer must send out data samples in the order they were added to its HistoryCache. 
 
Writers must include in-line QoS values if requested by a Reader 
A Writer must honor a Reader’s request to receive data messages with in-line QoS. 
 
Writers must send periodic HEARTBEAT Messages (reliable only) 
A Writer must periodically inform each matching reliable Reader of the availability of a data sample by sending 
a periodic HEARTBEAT Message that includes the sequence number of the available sample. If no samples are 
available, no HEARTBEAT Message needs to be sent.

## Page 74

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
68
For strict reliable communication, the Writer must continue to send HEARTBEAT Messages to a Reader until 
the Reader has either acknowledged receiving all available samples or has disappeared. In all other cases, the 
number of HEARTBEAT Messages sent can be implementation specific and may be finite. 
 
Writers must eventually respond to a negative acknowledgment (reliable only) 
When receiving an ACKNACK Message indicating a Reader is missing some data samples, the Writer must 
respond by either sending the missing data samples, sending a GAP message when the sample is not relevant, or 
sending a HEARTBEAT message when the sample is no longer available. 
The Writer may respond immediately or choose to schedule the response for a certain time in the future. It can 
also coalesce related responses so there need not be a one-to-one correspondence between an ACKNACK 
Message and the Writer’s response. These decisions and the timing characteristics are implementation specific. 
 
Sending Heartbeats and Gaps with Writer Group Information  
A Writer belonging to a Group shall send HEARTBEAT or GAP Submessages to its matched Readers even if 
the Reader has acknowledged all of that Writer’s samples. This is necessary for the Subscriber to detect the 
group sequence numbers that are not available in that Writer. The exception to this rule is when the Writer has 
sent DATA or DATA_FRAG Submessages that contain the same information. 
8.4.2.3 
Required RTPS Reader Behavior 
A best-effort Reader is completely passive as it only receives data and does not send messages itself. Therefore, 
the requirements below only apply to reliable Readers. 
 
Readers must respond eventually after receiving a HEARTBEAT with final flag not set 
Upon receiving a HEARTBEAT Message with final flag not set, the Reader must respond with an ACKNACK 
Message. The ACKNACK Message may acknowledge having received all the data samples or may indicate that 
some data samples are missing. 
The response may be delayed to avoid message storms. 
 
Readers must respond eventually after receiving a HEARTBEAT that indicates a sample is 
missing 
Upon receiving a HEARTBEAT Message, a Reader that is missing some data samples must respond with an 
ACKNACK Message indicating which data samples are missing. This requirement only applies if the Reader 
can accommodate these missing samples in its cache and is independent of the setting of the final flag in the 
HEARTBEAT Message. 
The response may be delayed to avoid message storms. 
The response is not required when a liveliness HEARTBEAT has both liveliness and final flags set to indicate it 
is a liveliness-only message. 
 
Once acknowledged, always acknowledged 
Once a Reader has positively acknowledged receiving a sample using an ACKNACK Message, it can no longer 
negatively acknowledge that same sample at a later point. 
Once a Writer has received positive acknowledgement from all Readers, the Writer can reclaim any associated 
resources. However, if a Writer receives a negative acknowledgement to a previously positively acknowledged 
sample, and the Writer can still service the request, the Writer should send the sample. 
 
Readers can only send an ACKNACK Message in response to a HEARTBEAT Message 
In steady state, an ACKNACK Message can only be sent as a response to a HEARTBEAT Message from a 
Writer. ACKNACK Messages can be sent from a Reader when it first discovers a Writer as an optimization. 
Writers are not required to respond to these pre-emptive ACKNACK Messages.

8.4.3 
Implementing the RTPS Protocol 
The RTPS specification states that a compliant implementation of the protocol need only satisfy the 
requirements presented in 8.4.2. Therefore, the behavior of actual implementations may differ as a function of 
the design trade-offs made by each implementation. 
The Behavior Module of the RTPS specification defines two reference implementations: 
Stateless Reference Implementation: The Stateless Reference Implementation is optimized for scalability. It 
keeps virtually no state on remote entities and therefore scales very well with large systems. This involves a 
trade-off, as improved scalability and reduced memory usage may require additional bandwidth usage. The 
Stateless Reference Implementation is ideally suited for best-effort communication over multicast. 
Stateful Reference Implementation: The Stateful Reference Implementation maintains full state on remote 
entities. This approach minimizes bandwidth usage, but requires more memory and may imply reduced 
scalability. In contrast to the Stateless Reference Implementation, it can guarantee strict reliable communication 
and is able to apply QoS-based or content-based filtering on the Writer side. 
Both reference implementations are described in detail in the sub clauses that follow. 
Actual implementations need not necessarily follow the reference implementations. Depending on how much 
state is maintained, implementations may be a combination of the reference implementations. 
For example, the Stateless Reference Implementation maintains minimal info and state on remote Entities. As 
such, it is not able to perform time-based filtering on the Writer side as this requires keeping track of each 
remote Reader and its properties. It is also not able to drop out-of-order samples on the Reader side as this 
requires keeping track of the largest sequence number received from each remote Writer. Some 
implementations may mimic the Stateless Reference Implementation, but choose to store enough additional 
state to be able to avoid some of the above limitations. The required additional information can be stored in a 
permanent fashion, in which case the implementation approaches the Stateful Reference Implementation, or can 
be slowly aged and kept around on an as needed basis to approximate, to the extent possible, the behavior that 
would result if the state were maintained. 
Regardless of the actual implementation, in order to guarantee interoperability, it is important that all 
implementations, including both reference implementations, satisfy the requirements presented in 8.4.2. 
8.4.4 
The Behavior of a Writer with respect to each matched Reader 
The behavior of an RTPS Writer with respect to each matched Reader depends on the setting of the 
reliabilityLevel attribute in the RTPS Writer and RTPS Reader. This controls whether a best-effort or a reliable 
protocol is used. 
Not all possible combinations of the reliabilityLevel are possible. An RTPS Writer cannot be matched to an 
RTPS Reader unless either the RTPS Writer has the reliabilityLevel set to RELIABLE, or else both the RTPS 
Writer and RTPS Reader have the reliabilityLevel set to BEST_EFFORT. This is because the DDS specification 
states that a BEST_EFFORT DDS DataWriter can only be matched with a BEST_EFFORT DDS DataReader 
and a RELIABLE DDS DataWriter can be matched with both a RELIABLE and a BEST_EFFORT DDS 
DataReader. 
As mentioned in 8.4.3, whether a Writer can be matched to a Reader does not depend on whether both use the 
same implementation of the RTPS protocol. That is, a Stateful Writer is able to communicate with a Stateless 
Reader and vice versa. 
8.4.5 
Notational Conventions 
The reference implementations are described using UML sequence charts and state-diagrams. These diagrams 
use some abbreviations to refer to the RTPS Entities. The abbreviations used are listed in Table 8.51.

RTPS StatelessWriter 
Specialization of RTPS Writer used for the Stateless Reference Implementation. The RTPS StatelessWriter has 
no knowledge of the number of matched readers, nor does it maintain any state for each matched RTPS Reader 
endpoint. The RTPS StatelessWriter maintains only the RTPS ReaderLocator list that should be used to send 
information to the matched readers.

RTPS StatefulWriter 
Specialization of RTPS Writer used for the Stateful Reference Implementation. The RTPS StatefulWriter is 
configured with the knowledge of all matched RTPS Reader endpoints and maintains state on each matched 
RTPS Reader endpoint. 
By maintaining state on each matched RTPS Reader endpoint, the RTPS StatefulWriter can determine whether 
all matched RTPS Reader endpoints have received a particular CacheChange and can be optimal in its use of

The matching of an RTPS StatefulWriter with an RTPS Reader means that the RTPS StatefulWriter will send 
the CacheChange changes in the writer’s HistoryCache to the matched RTPS Reader represented by the 
ReaderProxy. The matching is a consequence of the match of the corresponding DDS entities. That is, the DDS 
DataWriter matches a DDS DataReader by Topic, has compatible QoS, and is not being explicitly ignored by 
the application that uses DDS.

Transition T1 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Best-Effort StatelessWriter ‘the_rtps_writer’ with 
an RTPS ReaderLocator. This configuration is done by the Discovery protocol (8.5) as a consequence of the 
discovery of a DDS DataReader that matches the DDS DataWriter that is related to ‘the_rtps_writer.’

## Page 88

The discovery protocol supplies the values for the ReaderLocator constructor parameters. The transition 
performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_locator := new ReaderLocator( locator, expectsInlineQos ); 
the_rtps_writer.reader_locator_add( a_locator ); 
 
Transition T2 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RL::unsent_changes() == true] indicating that there are some 
changes in the RTPS Writer HistoryCache that have not been sent to the RTPS ReaderLocator. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T3 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RL::unsent_changes() == false] indicating that all changes in 
the RTPS Writer HistoryCache have been sent to the RTPS ReaderLocator. Note that this does not indicate that 
the changes have been received, only that an attempt was made to send them. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T4 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RL::can_send() == true] indicating that the RTPS Writer 
‘the_writer’ has the resources needed to send a change to the RTPS ReaderLocator ‘the_reader_locator.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_change_seq_num := the_reader_locator.next_unsent_change(); 
IF ( a_change_seq_num > the_reader_locator.higuest_sent_seq_num +1 ) { 
GAP = new GAP(the_reader_locator.higuest_sent_seq_num + 1,     
              a_change_seq_num - 1); 
GAP.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; 
GAP.filteredCount := 0; 
sendto the_reader_locator.locator, GAP; 
} 
 
a_change := the_writer.writer_cache.get_change(a_change_seq_num); 
DATA = new DATA(a_change); 
IF (the_reader_locator.expectsInlineQos) { 
    DATA.inlineQos := the_writer.related_dds_writer.qos; 
    DATA.inlineQos += a_change.inlineQos; 
} 
DATA.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; 
sendto the_reader_locator.locator, DATA; 
the_reader_locator.higuest_sent_seq_num := a_change_seq_num; 
The next unsent change ‘a_change’ present in the Writer Cache may not not have a sequence number that 
matches the ReaderLocator (higuest_sent_seq_num + 1). This may happen when a CacheChanges is removed 
from the Writer cache. For example, when using HISTORY QoS set to KEEP_LAST with depth == 1, a new 
change will cause the DDS DataWriter to remove the previous change from the HistoryCache. In this case a 
GAP message is sent to indicate a range of sequence numbers not available to the Reader. 
Since the GAP messages represent CacheChanges that are not present in the Writer cache, these changes do not 
appear counted in the GAP message filteredCount. 
After the transition, the following post-conditions hold: 
the_reader_locator.higuest_sent_seq_num == a_change_seq_num 
 
Transition T5 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Writer ‘the_rtps_writer’ to no longer send to the 
RTPS ReaderLocator ‘the_reader_locator.’ This configuration is done by the Discovery protocol (8.5) as a

consequence of breaking a pre-existing match of a DDS DataReader with the DDS DataWriter related to 
‘the_rtps_writer.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
the_rtps_writer.reader_locator_remove(the_reader_locator);  
delete the_reader_locator;

Transition T1 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Reliable StatelessWriter ‘the_rtps_writer’ with an 
RTPS ReaderLocator. This configuration is done by the Discovery protocol (8.5, ‘Discovery Module’) as a 
consequence of the discovery of a DDS DataReader that matches the DDS DataWriter that is related to 
‘the_rtps_writer.’ 
The discovery protocol supplies the values for the ReaderLocator constructor parameters. The transition 
performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_locator := new ReaderLocator( locator, expectsInlineQos ); 
the_rtps_writer.reader_locator_add( a_locator ); 
 
Transition T2 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RL::unsent_changes() == true] indicating that there are some 
changes in the RTPS Writer HistoryCache that have not been sent to the ReaderLocator. The transition 
performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T3 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RL::unsent_changes == false] indicating that all changes in 
the RTPS Writer HistoryCache have been sent to the ReaderLocator. Note that this does not indicate that the 
changes have been received, only that there has been an attempt made to send them. The transition performs no 
logical actions in the virtual machine.

matches the ReaderLocator (higuest_seq_num + 1). This may happen when a CacheChanges is removed from 
the Writer cache. For example, when using HISTORY QoS set to KEEP_LAST with depth == 1, a new change 
will cause the DDS DataWriter to remove the previous change from the HistoryCache. In this case a GAP 
message is sent to indicate a range of sequence numbers not available to the Reader. 
Since the GAP messages represent CacheChanges that are not present in the Writer cache, these changes do not 
appear counted in the GAP message filteredCount. 
After the transition the following post-conditions hold: 
the_reader_locator.higuest_sent_seq_num == a_change_seq_num 
 
Transition T5 
This transition is triggered by the firing of a periodic timer configured to fire each W::heartbeatPeriod. 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine for the Writer ‘the_rtps_writer’ and 
ReaderLocator ‘the_reader_locator.’ 
seq_num_min := the_rtps_writer.writer_cache.get_seq_num_min();  
seq_num_max := the_rtps_writer.writer_cache.get_seq_num_max(); 
HEARTBEAT := new HEARTBEAT(the_rtps_writer.writerGuid, seq_num_min,     
                                                                                              seq_num_max);  
HEARTBEAT.FinalFlag := SET; 
HEARTBEAT.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; 
sendto the_reader_locator, HEARTBEAT; 
 
Transition T6 
This transition is triggered by the reception of an ACKNACK message destined to the RTPS StatelessWriter 
‘the_rtps_writer’ originating from some RTPS Reader. 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
FOREACH reply_locator_t IN { Receiver.unicastReplyLocatorList, 
  Receiver.multicastReplyLocatorList }

## Page 92

86
reader_locator :=  the_rtps_writer.reader_locator_lookup(reply_locator_t); 
reader_locator.requested_changes_set(ACKNACK.readerSNState.set); 
Note that the processing of this message uses the reply locators in the RTPS Receiver. This is the only source of 
information for the StatelessWriter to determine where to send the reply to. Proper functioning of the protocol 
requires that the RTPS Reader inserts an InfoReply Submessage ahead of the AckNack such that these 
fields are properly set. 
 
Transition T7 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RL::requested_changes() != <empty>] indicating that there 
are changes that have been requested by some RTPS Reader reachable at the RTPS ReaderLocator. The 
transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T8 
This transition is triggered by the reception of an ACKNACK message destined to the RTPS StatelessWriter 
‘the_rtps_writer’ originating from some RTPS Reader. The transition performs the same logical actions 
performed by Transition T6 (8.4.8.2.6). 
 
Transition T9 
This transition is triggered by the firing of a timer indicating that the duration of W::nackResponseDelay has 
elapsed since the state must_repair was entered. The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual 
machine. 
 Transition T10 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RL::can_send() == true] indicating that the RTPS Writer 
‘the_writer’ has the resources needed to send a change to the RTPS ReaderLocator ‘the_reader_locator.’ The 
transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine. 
a_change_seq_num := the_reader_locator.next_requested_change();  
a_change := the_writer.writer_cache.get_change(a_change_seq_num );  
 
IF ( a_change != <nil> ) { 
DATA = new DATA(a_change); 
IF (the_reader_locator.expectsInlineQos) {  
   DATA.inlineQos := the_writer.related_dds_writer.qos; 
 
DATA.inlineQos += a_change.inlineQos; 
} 
DATA.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; 
sendto the_reader_locator.locator, DATA; 
} 
ELSE { 
GAP = new GAP(a_change.sequenceNumber);  
GAP.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; 
GAP.filteredCount := 0; 
sendto the_reader_locator.locator, GAP; 
} 
After the transition the following post-conditions hold: 
( a_change_seq_num BELONGS-TO the_reader_locator.requested_changes() ) == FALSE 
Note that it is possible that the requested change had already been removed from the HistoryCache by the DDS 
DataWriter. In that case, the StatelessWriter sends a GAP Message. The GAP message does not count the 
change in its message filteredCount because it corresponds to a change not present in the HistoryCache.

 Transition T11 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RL::requested_changes() == <empty>] indicating that there 
are no further changes requested by an RTPS Reader reachable at the RTPS ReaderLocator. The transition 
performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 Transition T12 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Writer ‘the_rtps_writer’ to no longer send to the 
RTPS ReaderLocator ‘the_reader_locator.’ This configuration is done by the Discovery protocol (8.5) as a 
consequence of breaking a pre-existing match of a DDS DataReader with the DDS DataWriter related to 
‘the_rtps_writer.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
the_rtps_writer.reader_locator_remove(the_reader_locator);  
delete the_reader_locator;

Transition T1 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Writer ‘the_rtps_writer’ with a matching RTPS 
Reader. This configuration is done by the Discovery protocol (8.5) as a consequence of the discovery of a DDS 
DataReader that matches the DDS DataWriter that is related to ‘the_rtps_writer.’ 
The discovery protocol supplies the values for the ReaderProxy constructor parameters. The transition performs 
the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_reader_proxy := new ReaderProxy( remoteReaderGuid, 
remoteGroupEntityId, expectsInlineQos, 
unicastLocatorList, multicastLocatorList); 
the_rtps_writer.matched_reader_add(a_reader_proxy); 
The ReaderProxy ‘a_reader_proxy’ is initialized as discussed in 8.4.7.5.  
 
Transition T2 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::unsent_changes() == true] indicating that there are some 
changes in the RTPS Writer HistoryCache that have not been sent to the RTPS Reader represented by the 
ReaderProxy. 
Note that for a Best-Effort Writer, W::pushMode == true, as there are no acknowledgements. Therefore, the 
Writer always pushes out data as it becomes available. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T3 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::unsent_changes() == false] indicating that all changes in 
the RTPS Writer HistoryCache have been sent to the RTPS Reader represented by the ReaderProxy. Note that 
this does not indicate that the changes have been received, only that there has been an attempt made to send 
them. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T4 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::can_send() == true] indicating that the RTPS Writer 
‘the_rtps_writer’ has the resources needed to send a change to the RTPS Reader represented by the 
ReaderProxy ‘the_reader_proxy.’

The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_change_seq_num := the_reader_proxy.next_unsent_change(); 
 
if ( a_change_seq_num > the_reader_proxy.higuest_sent_seq_num +1 ) { 
    GAP = new GAP(the_reader_locator.higuest_sent_seq_num + 1,    
              a_change_seq_num -1); 
    GAP.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; 
    GAP.filteredCount := 0; 
    send GAP; 
} 
 
a_change := the_writer.writer_cache.get_change(a_change_seq_num );  
 
if ( DDS_FILTER(the_reader_proxy, a_change) ) {  
    DATA = new DATA(a_change); 
    IF (the_reader_proxy.expectsInlineQos) { 
        DATA.inlineQos := the_rtps_writer.related_dds_writer.qos; 
        DATA.inlineQos += a_change.inlineQos; 
    } 
    DATA.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; 
    send DATA; 
} 
else { 
    GAP = new GAP(a_change.sequenceNumber);

    GAP.filteredCount := 1; 
    send GAP; 
} 
the_reader_proxy.higuest_sent_seq_num := a_change_seq_num; 
The next unsent change ‘a_change’ present in the Writer Cache may not not have a sequence number that 
matches the ReaderProxy (higuest_sent_seq_num + 1). This may happen when a CacheChanges is removed 
from the Writer cache. For example, when using HISTORY QoS set to KEEP_LAST with depth == 1 and a 
new change for the same instance (key) replaces the previous one from the HistoryCache. In this case a GAP 
message is sent to indicate a range of sequence numbers not available to the Reader. This GAP represents 
CacheChanges that are not present in the Writer cache. Therefore, these changes do not appear counted in the 
GAP message filteredCount. 
The next unsent change ‘a_change’ present in the Writer Cache may not pass a DDS_FILTER that indicates 
that the change is not relevant to thet Reader. This may happen, for example, of the Reader specified a Content 
Filter.  In this case a GAP is sent. However, this GAP represents CacheChanges that are present in the Writer 
cache but are not sent due to not being relevant. These changes do appear counted in the GAP message 
filteredCount. 
The above logic is not meant to imply that each DATA Submessage is sent in a separate RTPS Message. Rather 
multiple Submessages can be combined into a single RTPS message. 
After the transition, the following post-conditions hold: 
the_reader_proxy.higuest_sent_seq_num == a_change_seq_num 
 
Transition T5 
This transition is triggered by the addition of a new CacheChange ‘a_change’ to the HistoryCache of the RTPS 
Writer ‘the_rtps_writer’ by the corresponding DDS DataWriter. 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
ADD a_change TO the_rtps_writer.writer_cache; 
After the transition the following post-condition holds:

Transition T1 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Reliable StatefulWriter ‘the_rtps_writer’ with a 
matching RTPS Reader. This configuration is done by the Discovery protocol (8.5) as a consequence of the 
discovery of a DDS DataReader that matches the DDS DataWriter that is related to ‘the_rtps_writer.’ 
The discovery protocol supplies the values for the ReaderProxy constructor parameters. The transition performs 
the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_reader_proxy := new ReaderProxy( remoteReaderGuid, 
 remoteGroupEntityId, expectsInlineQos,  
unicastLocatorList, multicastLocatorList); 
the_rtps_writer.matched_reader_add(a_reader_proxy); 
The ReaderProxy ‘a_reader_proxy’ is initialized as discussed in 8.4.7.5. This includes initializing the set of 
unsent changes and applying a filter to each of the changes. 
 
Transition T2 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::unsent_changes() != <empty>] indicating that there are 
some changes in the RTPS Writer HistoryCache that have not been sent to the RTPS Reader represented by 
the ReaderProxy.

## Page 99

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
93 
 
 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T3 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::unsent_changes() == false] indicating that all changes in 
the RTPS Writer HistoryCache have been sent to the RTPS Reader represented by the ReaderProxy. Note that 
this does not indicate that the changes have been received, only that there has been an attempt made to send 
them. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T4 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::can_send() == true] indicating that the RTPS Writer 
‘the_rtps_writer’ has the resources needed to send a change to the RTPS Reader represented by the 
ReaderProxy ‘the_reader_proxy.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_change_seq_num := the_reader_proxy.next_unsent_change();  
 
if ( a_change_seq_num > the_reader_proxy.higuest_sent_seq_num +1 ) { 
    GAP = new GAP(the_reader_locator.higuest_sent_seq_num + 1,    
              a_change_seq_num -1); 
    GAP.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; 
    GAP.filteredCount := 0; 
    send GAP; 
} 
 
a_change := the_writer.writer_cache.get_change(a_change_seq_num );  
 
if ( DDS_FILTER(the_reader_proxy, a_change) ) {  
    DATA = new DATA(a_change); 
IF (the_reader_proxy.expectsInlineQos) { 
DATA.inlineQos := the_rtps_writer.related_dds_writer.qos; 
DATA.inlineQos += a_change.inlineQos; 
} 
DATA.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; // or ReaderProxy.entityId 
send DATA; 
} 
else { 
GAP = new GAP(a_change.sequenceNumber);  
GAP.filteredCount := 1; 
GAP.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN; // or ReaderProxy.entityId 
send GAP; 
} 
the_reader_proxy.higuest_sent_seq_num := a_change_seq_num; 
The next unsent change ‘a_change’ present in the Writer Cache may not not have a sequence number that 
matches the ReaderProxy (highest_sent_seq_num + 1). This may happen when a CacheChanges is removed 
from the Writer cache. For example, when using HISTORY QoS set to KEEP_LAST with depth == 1 and a 
new change for the same instance (key) replaces the previous one from the HistoryCache. In this case a GAP 
message is sent to indicate a range of sequence numbers not available to the Reader. This GAP represents 
CacheChanges that are not present in the Writer cache. Therefore, these changes do not appear counted in the 
GAP message filteredCount. 
The next unsent change ‘a_change’ present in the Writer Cache may not pass a DDS_FILTER that indicates 
that the change is not relevant to that Reader. This may happen, for example, of the Reader specified a Content 
Filter.  In this case a GAP is sent. However, this GAP represents CacheChanges that are present in the Writer 
cache but are not sent due to not being relevant. These changes do appear counted in the GAP message 
filteredCount.

The above logic is not meant to imply that each DATA or GAP Submessage is sent in a separate RTPS 
Message. Rather multiple Submessages can be combined into a single RTPS message. 
The above illustrates the simplified case where a GAP Submessage includes a single sequence number. This 
would result in potentially many Submessages in cases where many sequence numbers in close proximity refer 
to changes that are not relevant to the Reader. Efficient implementations will try to combine multiple ‘not 
available’ sequence numbers into a single GAP message. 
After the transition, the following post-conditions hold: 
the_reader_proxy.higuest_sent_seq_num == a_change_seq_num 
 
Transition T5 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::unacked_changes() == false] indicating 
that all changes in the RTPS Writer HistoryCache have been acknowledged by the RTPS Reader represented 
by the ReaderProxy. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T6 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::unacked_changes() == true] indicating that 
there are changes in the RTPS Writer HistoryCache have not been acknowledged by the RTPS Reader 
represented by the ReaderProxy. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 
Transition T7 
This transition is triggered by the firing of a periodic timer configured to fire each W::heartbeatPeriod. 
The transition performs the following logical actions for the StatefulWriter ‘the_rtps_writer’ in the virtual 
machine: 
seq_num_min := the_rtps_writer.writer_cache.get_seq_num_min();  
seq_num_max := the_rtps_writer.writer_cache.get_seq_num_max(); 
HEARTBEAT := new HEARTBEAT(the_rtps_writer.writerGuid,  
                           seq_num_min, seq_num_max);  
HEARTBEAT.FinalFlag := NOT_SET; 
HEARTBEAT.readerId := ENTITYID_UNKNOWN;  
send HEARTBEAT; 
 
Transition T8 
This transition is triggered by the reception of an ACKNACK Message destined to the RTPS StatefulWriter 
‘the_rtps_writer’ originating from the RTPS Reader represented by the ReaderProxy ‘the_reader_proxy.’ The 
transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
the_rtps_writer.acked_changes_set(ACKNACK.readerSNState.base - 1); 
the_reader_proxy.requested_changes_set(ACKNACK.readerSNState.set); 
After the transition the following post-conditions hold: 
MIN { change.sequenceNumber IN the_reader_proxy.unacked_changes() } >= 
                                                 ACKNACK.readerSNState.base - 1 
 
Transition T9 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::requested_changes() != <empty>] indicating that there 
are changes that have been requested by the RTPS Reader represented by the ReaderProxy. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine.

 Transition T10 
This transition is triggered by the reception of an ACKNACK message destined to the RTPS StatefulWriter 
‘the_writer’ originating from the RTPS Reader represented by the ReaderProxy ‘the_reader_proxy.’ 
The transition performs the same logical actions as Transition T8 (8.4.9.2.8). 
 Transition T11 
This transition is triggered by the firing of a timer indicating that the duration of W::nackResponseDelay has 
elapsed since the state must_repair was entered. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 Transition T12 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::can_send() == true] indicating that the RTPS Writer 
‘the_rtps_writer’ has the resources needed to send a change to the RTPS Reader represented by the 
ReaderProxy ‘the_reader_proxy.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_change := the_reader_proxy.next_requested_change();  
a_change.status := UNDERWAY; 
cache_change := the_rtps_writer.writer_cache.find(a_change.sequence_number); 
IF (  cache_change != NIL ) { 
    IF ( DDS_FILTER(the_reader_proxy, a_change) ) { 
        DATA = new DATA(cache_change, the_reader_proxy.remoteReaderGuid);  
        IF (the_reader_proxy.expectsInlineQos) { 
            DATA.inlineQos := the_rtps_writer.related_dds_writer.qos; 
            DATA.inlineQos += cache_change.inlineQos; 
        } 
        send DATA; 
    } 
    ELSE { 
        GAP = new GAP(a_change.sequenceNumber,  
                                                             the_reader_proxy.remoteReaderGuid);  
        GAP.filteredCount := 1; 
        send GAP; 
    } 
} 
ELSE { 
    GAP = new GAP(a_change.sequenceNumber,  
                                                   the_reader_proxy.remoteReaderGuid);  
    GAP.filteredCount := 0; 
    send GAP; 
} 
A requested change is identified by its sequence number. This change may still be in the Writer Cache or may 
have already been removed: 
• 
If the change is still in the Writer cache the writer will check if it is relevant to the Reader (i.e. if 
passes any reader-specified filters and was not specifically directed to other readers). If the change is 
relevant the Writer will send a DATA message with the change information. If it is not relevant it will 
send a GAP message and account for the filtering in the GAP’s filteredCount.  
• 
If the change is no longer in the Writer cache, the Writer will send a GAP and that change will not be 
counted in the GAP’s filteredCount. 
The above logic is not meant to imply that each DATA or GAP Submessage is sent in a separate RTPS 
message. Rather multiple Submessages can be combined into a single RTPS message. 
The above illustrates the simplified case where a GAP Submessage includes a single sequence number. This 
would result in potentially many Submessages in cases where many sequence numbers in close proximity refer

96
to changes that are not available to the Reader. Efficient implementations will combine multiple ‘not available’ 
sequence numbers as much as possible into a single GAP message. 
After the transition the following post-condition holds: 
( a_change BELONGS-TO the_reader_proxy.requested_changes() ) == FALSE 
 Transition T13 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [RP::requested_changes() == <empty>] indicating that there 
are no more changes requested by the RTPS Reader represented by the ReaderProxy. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 Transition T14 
This transition is triggered by the addition of a new CacheChange ‘a_change’ to the HistoryCache of the RTPS 
Writer ‘the_rtps_writer’ by the corresponding DDS DataWriter.  
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
ADD a_change TO the_rtps_writer.writer_cache; 
After the transition the following post-condition holds: 
FOREACH proxy IN the_rtps_writer.matched_readers    
    proxy.unsent_changes()  == true  
 Transition T15 
This transition is triggered by the removal of a CacheChange ‘a_change’ from the HistoryCache of the RTPS 
Writer ‘the_rtps_writer’ by the corresponding DDS DataWriter. For example, when using HISTORY QoS set to 
KEEP_LAST with depth == 1, a new change will cause the DDS DataWriter to remove the previous change for 
the same instance (key) from the HistoryCache. 
 Transition T16 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Writer ‘the_rtps_writer’ to no longer be matched 
with the RTPS Reader represented by the ReaderProxy ‘the_reader_proxy.’ This configuration is done by the 
Discovery protocol (8.5) as a consequence of breaking a pre-existing match of a DDS DataReader with the DDS 
DataWriter related to ‘the_rtps_writer.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
the_rtps_writer.matched_reader_remove(the_reader_proxy);  
    delete the_reader_proxy; 
8.4.10 RTPS Reader Reference Implementations 
The RTPS Reader Reference Implementations are based on specializations of the RTPS Reader class, first 
introduced in 8.2. This sub clause describes the RTPS Reader and all additional classes used to model the RTPS 
Reader Reference Implementations. The actual behavior is described in 8.4.11 and 8.4.12. 
8.4.10.1 RTPS Reader 
RTPS Reader specializes RTPS Endpoint and represents the actor that receives CacheChange messages from 
one or more RTPS Writer endpoints. The Reference Implementations StatelessReader and StatefulReader

8.4.10.2 RTPS StatelessReader 
Specialization of RTPS Reader. The RTPS StatelessReader has no knowledge of the number of matched 
writers, nor does it maintain any state for each matched RTPS Writer. 
In the current Reference Implementation, the StatelessReader does not add any configuration attributes or 
operations to those inherited from the Reader super class. Both classes are therefore identical. The virtual 
machine interacts with the StatelessReader using the operations in Table 8.69.

8.4.10.4 RTPS WriterProxy 
The RTPS WriterProxy represents the information an RTPS StatefulReader maintains on each matched RTPS 
Writer. The attributes of the RTPS WriterProxy are described in Table 8.72. 
The association is a consequence of the matching of the corresponding DDS Entities as defined by the DDS 
specification, that is the DDS DataReader matching a DDS DataWriter by Topic, having compatible QoS, 
belonging to a common partition, and not being explicitly ignored by the application that uses DDS.

This operation creates a new RTPS WriterProxy. 
The newly-created writer proxy ‘this’ is initialized as follows: 
this.attributes := <as specified in the constructor>;  
this.changes_from_writer := <all past and future samples from the writer>; 
The changes_from_writer of the newly-created WriterProxy is initialized to contain all past and future samples 
from the Writer represented by the WriterProxy. This is a conceptual representation only, used to describe the 
Stateful Reference Implementation. The ChangeFromWriter status of each CacheChange in 
changes_from_writer is initialized to UNKNOWN, indicating the StatefulReader initially does not know 
whether any of these changes actually already exist. As discussed in 8.4.12.3, the status will change to 
MISSING, RECEIVED, NOT_AVAILABLE (NA_UNSPECIFIED, NA_FILTERED, or NA_REMOVED) as 
the StatefulReader is informed about their existence via a HEARTBEAT message,  receives the actual changes 
via DATA or DATA_FRAG messages, or it is informed that the change is not available to the Reader and will 
not be delivered via a GAP or HEARTBEAT message.

 available_changes_max 
This operation returns the maximum SequenceNumber_t among the changes_from_writer changes in the RTPS 
WriterProxy that are available for access by the DDS DataReader. 
The condition to make any CacheChange ‘a_change’ available for ‘access’ by the DDS DataReader is that 
there are no changes from the RTPS Writer with SequenceNumber_t smaller than or equal to 
a_change.sequenceNumber that have status MISSING or UNKNOWN. In other words, the 
available_changes_max and all previous changes are either RECEIVED or NOT_AVAILABLE. 
Logical action in the virtual machine: 
seq_num := MAX { change.sequenceNumber SUCH-THAT 
( change IN this.changes_from_writer  
    AND ( change.status == RECEIVED 
          OR change.status == NOT_AVAILABLE) ) }; 
return seq_num; 
 not_available_change_set 
This operation modifies the status of a ChangeFromWriter to indicate that the CacheChange with the 
SequenceNumber_t ‘a_seq_num’ is not available to the RTPS Reader.  
The filteredCount parameter indicates the number of changes in the set that are still in the Writer cache but have 
been filtered for this Reader. The other changes are no longer present in the Writer cache so they should be 
considered as removed. 
This operation may provide bulk notification on a set of changes, identified by their sequence numbers. In this 
case it may not be possible to determine wether a specific change was filtered or removed. That will happen if 
value of the filteredCount does not equal zero or the total number of changes in the set. If it is not possible to 
determine whether a change was filtered or removed, then the change status should be set to 
NA_UNSPECIFIED. Otherwise it should be set to NA_FILTERED or NA_REMOVED, as appropriate. 
Logical action in the virtual machine: 
FOREACH change FROM this.changes_from_writer SUCH-THAT 
(change.sequenceNumber IN a_seq_num_set); 
    IF ( filteredCount == COUNT(this. a_seq_num_set) ) THEN 
        change.status := NA_FILTERED; 
    ELSE IF ( filteredCount == 0) 
        change.status := NA_REMOVED; 
    ELSE 
        change.status := NA_UNSPECIFIED; 
 lost_changes_update 
This operation modifies the status stored in ChangeFromWriter for any changes in the WriterProxy whose 
status is MISSING or UNKNOWN and have sequence numbers lower than ‘first_available_seq_num.’ The 
status of those changes is modified to NA_REMOVED or NA_UNSPECIFIED, depending on the value of the 
parameter ‘changes_removed’. If ‘changes_removed’ is true, it indicates that the changes are no longer 
available in the WriterHistoryCache of the RTPS Writer represented by the RTPS WriterProxy. 
Logical action in the virtual machine: 
FOREACH change IN this.changes_from_writer 
SUCH-THAT ( change.status == UNKNOWN OR change.status == MISSING  
    AND seq_num < first_available_seq_num ) DO { 
change.status := NA_REMOVED; 
}

## Page 109

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
103 
 
 
 missing_changes 
This operation returns the subset of changes for the WriterProxy that have status ‘MISSING.’ The changes with 
status ‘MISSING’ represent the set of changes available in the HistoryCache of the RTPS Writer represented 
by the RTPS WriterProxy that have not been received by the RTPS Reader. 
return { change IN this.changes_from_writer  
                SUCH-THAT change.status == MISSING}; 
 missing_changes_update 
This operation modifies the status stored in ChangeFromWriter for any changes in the WriterProxy whose 
status is UNKNOWN and have sequence numbers smaller or equal to ‘last_available_seq_num.’ The status of 
those changes is modified from UNKNOWN to MISSING indicating that the changes are available at the 
WriterHistoryCache of the RTPS Writer represented by the RTPS WriterProxy but have not been received by 
the RTPS Reader. 
Logical action in the virtual machine: 
FOREACH change IN this.changes_from_writer  
       SUCH-THAT ( change.status == UNKNOWN 
AND seq_num <= last_available_seq_num ) DO {  
change.status := MISSING; 
} 
 received_change_set 
This operation modifies the status of the ChangeFromWriter that refers to the CacheChange with the 
SequenceNumber_t ‘a_seq_num.’ The status of the change is set to ‘RECEIVED,’ indicating it has been 
received. Logical action in the virtual machine: 
FIND change FROM this.changes_from_writer  
         SUCH-THAT change.sequenceNumber == a_seq_num;  
change.status := RECEIVED 
8.4.10.5 RTPS ChangeFromWriter 
The RTPS ChangeFromWriter is an association class that maintains information of a CacheChange in the 
RTPS Reader HistoryCache as it pertains to the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy. 
The attributes of the RTPS ChangeFromWriter are described in Table 8.74.

The type ChangeFromWriter StatusKind is an enumeration that can take the following values:

## Page 110

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
104
• 
UNKNOWN. This means that the Reader has not received the change and it is not known if the change 
is in the WriterCache.  It may be not have been written yet (i.e. is a change potentially in the future), it 
may be in the WriterCache, or it may have been written and removed from the WriterCache.  
• 
MISSING. This means that the Reader has been informed that the Writer has potentially this change in 
its WriterCache so the Reader can request it. 
• 
RECEIVED. This means that the Reader has received the change via DATA or DATA_FRAG 
messages. 
• 
NOT_AVAILABLE. This means that the Reader has been informed that the change will not be sent by 
the Writer. There are three possible sub-statuses: 
o 
NA_FILTERED. This the change is in the WriterCache but it will not be sent to the Reader 
because the Writer has filtered it for the Reader. 
o 
NA_REMOVED. This means the change was at some point in the WriterCache but it is no 
longer there and therefore it will not be delivered to the Reader. 
o 
NA_ UNSPECIFIED. This means that the Writer did not provide enough information for the 
the Reader to determine the reason why the change is not available to the Reader.  
8.4.11 RTPS StatelessReader Behavior 
8.4.11.1 Best-Effort StatelessReader Behavior 
The behavior of the Best-Effort RTPS StatelessReader is independent of any writers and is described in Figure 
8.22.

 Transition T1 
This transition is triggered by the creation of an RTPS StatelessReader ‘the_rtps_reader.’ This is the result of 
the creation of a DDS DataReader as described in 8.2.10.

## Page 111

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
105 
 
 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 Transition T2 
This transition is triggered by the reception of a DATA message by the RTPS Reader ‘the_rtps_reader.’ The 
DATA message contains the change ‘a_change.’ The representation is described in 8.3.8.2. 
The stateless nature of the StatelessReader prevents it from maintaining the information required to determine 
the highest sequence number received so far from the originating RTPS Writer. The consequence is that in those 
cases the corresponding DDS DataReader may be presented duplicate or out-of order changes. Note that if the 
DDS DataReader is configured to order data by ‘source timestamp,’ any available data will still be presented in-
order when accessing the data through the DDS DataReader. 
As mentioned in 8.4.3, actual stateless implementations may try to avoid this limitation and maintain this 
information in non-permanent fashion (using for example a cache that expires information after a certain time) 
to approximate, to the extent possible, the behavior that would result if the state were maintained. 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_change := new CacheChange(DATA); 
the_rtps_reader.reader_cache.add_change(a_change); 
 Transition T3 
This transition is triggered by the destruction of an RTPS Reader ‘the_rtps_reader.’ This is the result of the 
destruction of a DDS DataReader as described in 8.2.10. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
8.4.11.2 Reliable StatelessReader Behavior 
This combination is not supported by the RTPS protocol. In order to implement the reliable protocol, the RTPS 
Reader must keep some state on each matched RTPS Writer. 
8.4.12 RTPS StatefulReader Behavior 
8.4.12.1 Best-Effort StatefulReader Behavior 
The behavior of the Best-Effort RTPS StatefulReader with respect to each matched Writer is described in

 Transition T1 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Reader ‘the_rtps_reader’ with a matching RTPS 
Writer. This configuration is done by the Discovery protocol (8.5) as a consequence of the discovery of a DDS 
DataWriter that matches the DDS DataReader that is related to ‘the_rtps_reader.’ 
The discovery protocol supplies the values for the WriterProxy constructor parameters. The transition performs 
the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_writer_proxy := new WriterProxy(remoteWriterGuid, 
remoteGroupEntityId, unicastLocatorList, 
multicastLocatorList); 
the_rtps_reader.matched_writer_add(a_writer_proxy); 
TheWriterProxy is initialized with all past and future samples from the Writer as discussed in 8.4.10.4.

## Page 113

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
107 
 
 
 Transition T2 
This transition is triggered by the reception of a DATA message by the RTPS Reader ‘the_rtps_reader.’ The 
DATA message contains the change ‘a_change.’ The representation is described in 8.3.8.2. 
The Best-Effort reader checks that the sequence number associated with the change is strictly greater than the 
highest sequence number of all changes received in the past from this RTPS Writer 
(WP::available_changes_max()). If this check fails, the RTPS Reader discards the change. This ensures that 
there are no duplicate changes and no out-of-order changes. 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_change := new CacheChange(DATA); 
writer_guid := {Receiver.SourceGuidPrefix, DATA.writerId};  
writer_proxy := the_rtps_reader.matched_writer_lookup(writer_guid); 
expected_seq_num := writer_proxy.available_changes_max() + 1; 
 
if ( a_change.sequenceNumber >= expected_seq_num ) { 
the_rtps_reader.reader_cache.add_change(a_change); 
writer_proxy.received_change_set(a_change.sequenceNumber);  
 
    if ( a_change.sequenceNumber > expected_seq_num ) { 
  writer_proxy.lost_changes_update(a_change.sequenceNumber, false); 
} 
} 
After the transition the following post-conditions hold: 
writer_proxy.available_changes_max() >= a_change.sequenceNumber 
 Transition T3 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Reader ‘the_rtps_reader’ to no longer be matched 
with the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy ‘the_writer_proxy.’ This configuration is done by the 
Discovery protocol (8.5) as a consequence of breaking a pre-existing match of a DDS DataWriter with the DDS 
DataReader related to ‘the_rtps_reader.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
the_rtps_reader.matched_writer_remove(the_writer_proxy);  
delete the_writer_proxy; 
 Transition T4 
This transition is triggered by reception of a GAP message destined to the RTPS StatefulReader ‘the_reader’ 
originating from the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy ‘the_writer_proxy’. 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
the_writer_proxy.not_available_change_set(GAP. sequence_number_set,  
                                          GAP.filteredCount); 
8.4.12.2 Reliable StatefulReader Behavior

 Transition T1 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Reliable StatefulReader ‘the_rtps_reader’ with a 
matching RTPS Writer. This configuration is done by the Discovery protocol (8.5) as a consequence of the 
discovery of a DDS DataWriter that matches the DDS DataReader that is related to ‘the_rtps_reader.’ 
The discovery protocol supplies the values for the WriterProxy constructor parameters. The transition performs 
the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_writer_proxy := new WriterProxy(remoteWriterGuid, 
remoteGroupEntityId, unicastLocatorList, 
multicastLocatorList); 
the_rtps_reader.matched_writer_add(a_writer_proxy); 
TheWriterProxy is initialized with all past and future samples from the Writer as discussed in 8.4.10.4. 
 Transition T2 
This transition is triggered by the reception of a HEARTBEAT message destined to the RTPS StatefulReader 
‘the_reader’ originating from the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy ‘the_writer_proxy.’ 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. Note however that the reception of a 
HEARTBEAT message causes the concurrent transition T7 (8.4.12.2.7), which performs logical actions. 
 Transition T3 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [W::missing_changes() == <empty>] indicating that all 
changes known to be in the HistoryCache of the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy have been 
received by the RTPS Reader. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 Transition T4 
This transition is triggered by the guard condition [W::missing_changes() != <empty>] indicating that there are 
some changes known to be in the HistoryCache of the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy, which 
have not been received by the RTPS Reader. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 Transition T5 
This transition is triggered by the firing of a timer indicating that the duration of R::heartbeatResponseDelay has 
elapsed since the state must_send_ack was entered. 
The transition performs the following logical actions for the WriterProxy ‘the_writer_proxy’ in the virtual 
machine: 
missing_seq_num_set.base := the_writer_proxy.available_changes_max() + 1; 
missing_seq_num_set.set := <empty>;

## Page 116

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
110
FOREACH change IN the_writer_proxy.missing_changes() DO  
    ADD change.sequenceNumber TO missing_seq_num_set.set; 
send ACKNACK(missing_seq_num_set); 
The above logical action does not express the fact that the PSM mapping of the ACKNACK message will be 
limited in its capacity to contain sequence numbers. In the case where the ACKNACK message cannot 
accommodate the complete list of missing sequence numbers it should be constructed such that it contains the 
subset with smallest value of the sequence number. 
 Transition T6 
Similar to T1 (8.4.12.2.1), this transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Reliable StatefulReader 
‘the_rtps_reader’ with a matching RTPS Writer. 
The transition performs no logical actions in the virtual machine. 
 Transition T7 
This transition is triggered by the reception of a HEARTBEAT message destined to the RTPS StatefulReader 
‘the_reader’ originating from the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy ‘the_writer_proxy.’ 
The firstSN in the HEARTBEAT message indicates the lowest sequence number in the Writer cache. For this 
reason, the call to lost_changes_updates sets the parameter removed_samples to ‘true’. 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
the_writer_proxy.missing_changes_update(HEARTBEAT.lastSN); 
the_writer_proxy.lost_changes_update(HEARTBEAT.firstSN, true); 
 Transition T8 
This transition is triggered by the reception of a DATA message destined to the RTPS StatefulReader 
‘the_reader’ originating from the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy ‘the_writer_proxy.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
a_change := new CacheChange(DATA); 
the_reader.reader_cache.add_change(a_change); 
the_writer_proxy.received_change_set(a_change.sequenceNumber); 
Any filtering is done when accessing the data using the DDS DataReader read or take operations, as described 
in 8.2.10. 
 Transition T9 
This transition is triggered by the reception of a GAP message destined to the RTPS StatefulReader 
‘the_reader’ originating from the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy ‘the_writer_proxy.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
the_writer_proxy.not_available_change_set(GAP. sequence_number_set,  
                                          GAP.filteredCount); 
 
Transition T10 
This transition is triggered by the configuration of an RTPS Reader ‘the_rtps_reader’ to no longer be matched 
with the RTPS Writer represented by the WriterProxy ‘the_writer_proxy.’ This configuration is done by the 
Discovery protocol (8.5) as a consequence of breaking a pre-existing match of a DDS DataWriter with the DDS 
DataReader related to ‘the_rtps_reader.’ 
The transition performs the following logical actions in the virtual machine: 
the_rtps_reader.matched_writer_remove(the_writer_proxy);  
delete the_writer_proxy;

8.4.12.3 ChangeFromWriter illustrated 
The ChangeFromWriter keeps track of the communication status (attribute status) and relevance (attribute 
is_relevant) of each CacheChange with respect to a specific remote RTPS Writer. 
The behavior of the RTPS StatefulReader described in Figure 8.24 modifies each ChangeFromWriter as a 
side-effect of the operation of the protocol. To further define the protocol, it is illustrative to examine the State 
Machine representing the value of the status attribute for any given ChangeFromWriter. This is shown in 
Figure 8.25 for a Reliable StatefulReader. A Best-Effort StatefulReader uses only a subset of the state-
diagram. 
 
Figure 8.25 - Changes in the value of the status attribute of each ChangeFromWriter 
The states have the following meanings: 
• 
<Unknown>: A CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num may or may not be available 
yet at the RTPS Writer. 
• 
<Missing>: The CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num is available in the RTPS 
Writer and has not been received yet by the RTPS Reader. 
• 
<NotRequested>: The CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num has not been requested 
from the RTPS Writer, no response is expected  
• 
<Requested>: The CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num was requested from the 
RTPS Writer, a response might be pending or underway. 
• 
<Received>: The CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num was received: as a DATA. 
• 
<NotAvailable>: The CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num is no longer available at 
the RTPS Writer. It will not be received. The Reader has received this information via a 
HEARTBEAT or a GAP without an indication that the change was filtered. There are 3 
substates: 
• 
<Filtered>:  The CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num was received as a GAP with 
an indication the that change was filtered by the Writer for this reader.  
• 
<Removed>:  The CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num was received as a GAP with 
an indication the that change was not filtered by the Writer. Or it was received as a 
HEARTBEAT and the Reader is reliable. 
• 
<Unspecified>:  The CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num was received as a GAP 
with not enough information to determine whether it was filtered or not.

The following describes the main events that trigger transitions in the State Machine. Note that this state-
machine just keeps track of the ‘status’ attribute of a particular ChangeForReader and does not perform any 
specific actions nor send any messages. 
• 
new ChangeFromWriter(seq_num): The WriterProxy has created a ChangeFromWriter 
association class to track the state of a CacheChange with SequenceNumber_t seq_num. 
• 
received HB(firstSN <= seq_num <= lastSN): The Reader has received a HEARTBEAT with 
HEARTBEAT.firstSN <= seq_num <= HEARTBEAT.lastSN, indicating a CacheChange with 
that sequence number is available from the RTPS Writer. 
• 
sent NACK(seq_num) : The Reader has sent an ACKNACK message containing the seq_num 
inside the ACKNACK.readerSNState, indicating the RTPS Reader has not received the 
CacheChange and is requesting it is sent again. 
• 
received GAP(seq_num) : The Reader has received a GAP message where seq_num is inside 
GAP.gapList, which means that the seq_num will not be sent to the RTPS Reader. 
• 
The GAP may contain an indication that the cache change is still available in the Writer but was 
filtered for the Reader. 
• 
received DATA(seq_num) : The Reader has received a DATA message with 
DATA.sequenceNumber == seq_num. 
• 
received HB(firstSN > seq_num) : The Reader has received a HEARTBEAT with 
HEARTBEAT.firstSN > seq_num, indicating the CacheChange with that sequence number is no 
longer present in the RTPS Writer cache. 
8.4.13 Writer Liveliness Protocol 
The DDS specification requires the presence of a liveliness mechanism. RTPS realizes this requirement with the 
Writer Liveliness Protocol. The Writer Liveliness Protocol defines the required information exchange between 
two Participants in order to assert the liveliness of Writers contained by the Participants. 
All implementations must support the Writer Liveliness Protocol in order to be interoperable. 
8.4.13.1 General Approach 
The Writer Liveliness Protocol uses pre-defined built-in Endpoints. The use of built-in Endpoints means that 
once a Participant knows of the presence of another Participant, it can assume the presence of the built-in 
Endpoints made available by the remote Participant and establish the association with the locally matching 
built-in Endpoints. 
The protocol used to communicate between built-in Endpoints is the same as used for application-defined 
Endpoints. 
8.4.13.2 Built-in Endpoints Required by the Writer Liveliness Protocol 
The built-in Endpoints required by the Writer Liveliness Protocol are the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and 
BuiltinParticipantMessageReader. The names of these Endpoints reflect the fact that they are general-purpose. 
These Endpoints are used for liveliness but can be used for other data in the future. 
The RTPS Protocol reserves the following values of the EntityId_t for these built-in Endpoints: 
ENTITYID_P2P_BUILTIN_PARTICIPANT_MESSAGE_WRITER 
ENTITYID_P2P_BUILTIN_PARTICIPANT_MESSAGE_READER 
The actual value for each of these EntityId_t instances is defined by each PSM. 
8.4.13.3 BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and BuiltinParticipantMessageReader QoS 
For interoperability, both the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and BuiltinParticipantMessageReader shall use 
the following QoS values: 
• durability.kind = TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY 
• history.kind = KEEP_LAST_HISTORY_QOS

## Page 119

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
113 
 
 
• history.depth = 1 
The BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter shall use reliability.kind = RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS. 
The BuiltinParticipantMessageReader may be configured to use either RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS or 
BEST_EFFORT_RELIABILITY_QOS. If the BuiltinParticipantMessageReader is configured to use 
BEST_EFFORT_RELIABILITY_QOS then the 
BEST_EFFORT_PARTICIPANT_MESSAGE_DATA_READER flag in ParticipantProxy::builtinEndpointQos 
shall be set. 
If the ParticipantProxy::builtinEndpointQos is included in the SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData, then the 
BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter shall treat the BuiltinParticipantMessageReader as indicated by the flags. If 
the ParticipantProxy::builtinEndpointQos is not included then the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter shall treat 
the BuiltinParticipantMessageReader as if it is configured with RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS. 
8.4.13.4 Data Types Associated with Built-in Endpoints used by Writer Liveliness Protocol 
Each RTPS Endpoint has a HistoryCache that stores changes to the data-objects associated with the Endpoint. 
This is also true for the RTPS built-in Endpoints. Therefore, each RTPS built-in Endpoint depends on some 
DataType that represents the logical contents of the data written into its HistoryCache. 
Figure 8.26 defines the ParticipantMessageData datatype associated with the RTPS built-in Endpoint for the 
DCPSParticipantMessage Topic. 
 
Figure 8.26 - Participant Message Data 
8.4.13.5 Implementing Writer Liveliness Protocol Using the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter 
and Builtin- ParticipantMessageReader 
The liveliness of a subset of Writers belonging to a Participant is asserted by writing a sample to the 
BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter. If the Participant contains one or more Writers with a liveliness of 
AUTOMATIC_LIVELINESS_QOS, then one sample is written at a rate faster than the smallest lease duration 
among the Writers sharing this QoS. Similarly, a separate sample is written if the Participant contains one or 
more Writers with a liveliness of MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT_LIVELINESS_QOS at a rate faster than the 
smallest lease duration among these Writers. The two instances are orthogonal in purpose so that if a 
Participant contains Writers of each of the two liveliness kinds described, two separate instances must be 
periodically written. The instances are distinguished using their DDS key, which is comprised of the 
participantGuidPrefix and kind fields. Each of the two types of liveliness QoS handled through this protocol 
will result in a unique kind field and therefore form two distinct instances in the HistoryCache. 
In both liveliness cases the participantGuidPrefix field contains the GuidPrefix_t of the Participant that is 
writing the data (and therefore asserting the liveliness of its Writers). 
The DDS liveliness kind MANUAL_BY_TOPIC_LIVELINESS_QOS is not implemented using the 
BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and BuiltinParticipantMessageReader. It is discussed in 8.7.2.2.3. 
8.4.14 Optional Behavior 
This sub clause describes optional features of the RTPS protocol. Optional features may not be supported by all 
RTPS implementations. An optional feature does not affect basic interoperability, but is only available if all 
implementations involved support it.

8.4.14.1 Large Data 
As described in 7.6, RTPS poses very few requirements on the underlying transport. It is sufficient that the 
transport offers a connectionless service capable of sending packets best-effort. 
That said, a transport may impose its own limitations. For example, it may limit the maximum packet size (e.g., 
64K for UDP) and hence the maximum RTPS Submessage size. This mainly affects the Data Submessage, as 
it limits the maximum size of the serializedData or also, the maximum serialized size of the data type used. 
In order to address this limitation, 8.3.8 introduces the following Submessages to enable fragmenting large data: 
• DataFrag 
• HeartbeatFrag 
• NackFrag 
The following sub clauses list the corresponding behavior required for interoperability. 
 How to select the fragment size 
The fragment size is determined by the Writer and must meet the following requirements: 
• 
All transports available to the Writer must be able to accommodate DataFrag Submessages 
containing at least one fragment. This means the transport with the smallest maximum message size 
determines the fragment size. 
• 
The fragment size must be fixed for a given Writer and is identical for all remote Readers. By fixing the 
fragment size, the data a fragment number refers to does not depend on a particular remote Reader. 
This simplifies processing negative acknowledgements (NackFrag) from a Reader. 
• 
The fragment size must satisfy: fragment size <= 65536 bytes. 
Note the fragment size is determined by all transports available to the Writer, not simply the subset of transports 
required to reach all currently known Readers. This ensures newly discovered Readers, regardless of the 
transport they can be reached on, can be accommodated without having to change the fragment size, which 
would violate the above requirements. 
 How to send fragments 
If fragmentation is required, a Data Submessage is replaced by a sequence of DataFrag Submessages. The 
protocol behavior for sending DataFrag Submessages matches that for sending regular Data Submessages 
with the following additional requirements: 
• 
DataFrag Submessages are sent in order, where ordering is defined by increasing fragment numbers. 
Note this does not guarantee in order arrival. 
• 
Data must only be fragmented if required. If multiple transports are available to the Writer and some 
transports do not require fragmentation, a regular Data Submessage must be sent on those transports 
instead. Likewise, for variable size data types, a regular Data Submessage must be used if 
fragmentation is not required for a particular sequence number. 
• 
For a given sequence number, if in-line QoS parameters are used, they must be included with the first 
DataFrag Submessage (containing the fragment with fragment number equal to 1). They may also 
be included with subsequent DataFrag submessages for this sequence number, but this is not 
required. 
If a transport can accommodate multiple fragments of the given fragment size, it is recommended that 
implementations concatenate as many fragments as possible into a single DataFrag message.

## Page 121

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
115 
 
 
When sending multiple DataFrag messages, flow control may be required to avoid flooding the network. 
Possible approaches include a leaky bucket or token bucket flow control scheme. This is not part of the RTPS 
specification. 
 How to re-assemble fragments 
DataFrag Submessages contain all required information to re-assemble the serialized data. Once all 
fragments have been received, the same protocol behavior applies as for a regular Data Submessage. 
Note that implementations must be able to handle out-of-order arrival of DataFrag submessages. 
 Reliable Communication 
The protocol behavior for reliably sending DataFrag Submessages matches that for sending regular Data 
Submessages with the following additional requirements: 
• 
The semantics for a Heartbeat Submessage remains unchanged: A Heartbeat message must only 
include those sequence numbers for which all fragments are available. 
• 
The semantics for an AckNack Submessage remain unchanged: an AckNack message must only 
positively acknowledge a sequence number when all fragments were received for that sequence 
number. Likewise, a sequence number must be negatively acknowledged only when all fragments are 
missing. 
• 
In order to negatively acknowledge a subset of fragments for a given sequence number, a NackFrag 
Submessage must be used. When data is fragmented, a Heartbeat may trigger both AckNack and 
NackFrag Submessages. 
Additional considerations: 
• 
As mentioned above, a Heartbeat Submessage can only include a sequence number once all 
fragments for that sequence number are available. If a Writer wants to inform a Reader on the partial 
availability of fragments for a given sequence number, a HeartbeatFrag Submessage can be used 
instead. Fragment level reliability may be helpful for very large data and when using flow control. 
• 
A NackFrag Submessage can only be sent in response to a Heartbeat or HeartbeatFrag 
submessage. 
8.4.15 Implementation Guidelines 
The contents of this sub clause are not part of the formal specification of the protocol. The purpose of this sub 
clause is to provide guidelines for high-performance implementations of the protocol. 
8.4.15.1 Implementation of ReaderProxy and WriterProxy 
The PIM models the ReaderProxy as maintaining an association with each CacheChange in the Writer’s 
HistoryCache. This association is modeled as being mediated by the association class ChangeForReader. The 
direct implementation of this model would result in a lot of information being maintained for each 
ReaderProxy. In practice, what is required is that the ReaderProxy is able to implement the operations used by 
the protocol and this does not require the use of explicit associations. 
For example, the operations unsent_changes() and next_unsent_change() can be implemented by having the 
ReaderProxy maintain a single sequence number ‘highestSeqNumSent.’ The highestSeqNumSent would record 
the highest value of the sequence number of any CacheChange sent to the ReaderProxy. Using this the 
operation unsent_changes() could be implemented by looking up all changes in the HistoryCache and selecting 
the ones with sequenceNumber greater than highestSeqNumSent. The implementation of next_unsent_change() 
would also look at the HistoryCache and return the CacheChange that has the next-highest sequence number

## Page 122

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
116
greater than highestSeqNumSent. These operations could be done efficiently if the HistoryCache maintains an 
index by sequenceNumber. 
The same techniques can be used to implement, requested_changes(), requested_changes_set(), and 
next_requested_change(). In this case, the implementation can maintain a sliding window of sequence numbers 
(which can be efficiently represented by a SequenceNumber_t lowestRequestedChange and a fixed-length 
bitmap) to store whether a particular sequence number is currently requested. Requests that do not fit in the 
window can be ignored as they correspond to sequence numbers higher than the ones in the window and the 
reader can be relied on resending the request later if it is still missing the change. 
Similar techniques can be used to implement acked_changes_set() and unacked_changes(). 
8.4.15.2 Efficient use of Gap and AckNack Submessages 
Both Gap and AckNack Submessages are designed such that they can contain information about a set of 
sequence numbers. For simplicity, the virtual machine used in the protocol description did not always attempt to 
fully use these Submessages to store all the sequence numbers for which they would apply. The result would be 
that sometimes multiple Gap or AckNack messages would be sent when, a more efficient implementation, 
would have combined these Submessages into a single one. All these implementations are compliant with the 
protocol and interoperable. However, implementations that combine multiple Gap and AckNack 
Submessages and take advantage of the ability of these Submessages to contain a set of sequence number will 
be more efficient in both bandwidth and CPU usage. 
8.4.15.3 Coalescing multiple Data Submessages 
The RTPS protocol allows multiple Submessages to be coalesced into a single RTPS message. This means that 
they will all share a single RTPS Header and be sent in a single ‘network-transport transaction.’ Most network-
transports have a relatively-large fixed overhead compared with the extra cost of additional bytes in the 
message. Therefore, implementations that combine Submessages into a single RTPS message will in general 
make better utilization of CPU and bandwidth. 
A particularly common case is the coalescing of multiple Data Submessages into a single RTPS message. The 
need for this can occur in a response to an AckNack requesting multiple changes or as a result of multiple 
changes made on the writer side that have not yet been propagated to the reader. In all these cases, it is generally 
beneficial to coalesce the Submessages into fewer RTPS messages. 
Note that the coalescing of Data Submessages is not restricted to Submessages originating from the same 
RTPS Writer. It is also possible to coalesce Submessages originating from multiple RTPS Writer entities. RTPS 
Writer entities that correspond to DDS DataWriter entities belonging to the same DDS Publisher are prime 
candidates for this. 
8.4.15.4 Piggybacking HeartBeat Submessages 
The RTPS protocol allows Submessages of different kinds to be coalesced into a single RTPS message. A 
particularly useful case is the piggybacking of HeartBeat Submessages following Data Submessages. This 
allows the RTPS Writer to explicitly request an acknowledgment of the changes it sent without the additional 
traffic needed to send a separate HeartBeat. 
8.4.15.5 Sending to unknown readerId 
As described in the Messages Module, it is possible to send RTPS Messages where the readerId is left 
unspecified (ENTITYID_UNKNOWN). This is required when sending these Messages over Multicast, but also 
allows to send a single Message over unicast to reach multiple Readers within the same Participant. 
Implementations are encouraged to use this feature to minimize bandwidth usage.

8.4.15.6 Reclaiming Finite Resources from Unresponsive Readers 
An implementation likely has finite resources to work with. For a Writer, reclaiming queue resources should 
happen when all Readers have acknowledged a sample in the queue and resources limits dictate that the old 
sample entry is to be used for a new sample. 
There may be scenarios where an alive Reader becomes unresponsive and will never acknowledge the Writer. 
Instead of blocking on the unresponsive Reader, the Writer should be allowed to deem the Reader as ‘Inactive’ 
and proceed in updating its queue. The state of a Reader is either Active or Inactive. Active Readers have sent 
ACKNACKs that have been recently received. The Writer should determine the inactivity of a Reader by 
using a mechanism based on the rate and number of ACKNACKs received. Then samples that have been 
acknowledged by all Active Readers can be freed, and the Writer can reclaim those resources if necessary. Note 
that strict reliability is not guaranteed when a Reader becomes Inactive. 
8.4.15.7 Setting Count in Heartbeat, HeartbeatFrag, AckNack, and NackFrag submessages 
The Count element of a HEARTBEAT differentiates between logical HEARTBEATs. A received 
HEARTBEAT with the same Count as a previously received HEARTBEAT can be ignored to prevent 
triggering a duplicate repair session. So, an implementation should ensure that same logical HEARTBEATs are 
tagged with the same Count. 
The HEARTBEATS received by a Reader should have Counts greater than all older HEARTBEATs from the 
same Writer. Otherwise they can be discarded. As long as this requirement is met, it is up to the implementation 
to decide whether a Writer keeps a Count specific to each Reader or the Count is shared among all of its 
matching Readers. The same logic applies for Counts of ACKNACKs. It is up to the implementation to decide 
whether a Reader keeps a Count specific to each Writer or if it is shared among all of its matching Writers. 
The Count element should be incremented and compared according to modular arithmetic rules in order to 
accommodate the integer overflow. 
8.5 
Discovery Module 
The RTPS Behavior Module assumes RTPS Endpoints are properly configured and paired up with matching 
remote Endpoints. It does not make any assumptions on how this configuration took place and only defines how 
to exchange data between these Endpoints. 
In order to be able to configure Endpoints, implementations must obtain information on the presence of remote 
Endpoints and their properties. How to obtain this information is the subject of the Discovery Module. 
The Discovery Module defines the RTPS discovery protocol. The purpose of the discovery protocol is to allow 
each RTPS Participant to discover other relevant Participants and their Endpoints. Once remote Endpoints 
have been discovered, implementations can configure local Endpoints accordingly to establish communication. 
The DDS specification equally relies on the use of a discovery mechanism to establish communication between 
matched DataWriters and DataReaders. DDS implementations must automatically discover the presence of 
remote entities, both when they join and leave the network. This discovery information is made accessible to the 
user through DDS built-in topics. 
The RTPS discovery protocol defined in this Module provides the required discovery mechanism for DDS. 
8.5.1 
Overview 
The RTPS specification splits up the discovery protocol into two independent protocols: 
1. Participant Discovery Protocol 
2. Endpoint Discovery Protocol 
A Participant Discovery Protocol (PDP) specifies how Participants discover each other in the network. Once 
two Participants have discovered each other, they exchange information on the Endpoints they contain using an

## Page 124

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
118
Endpoint Discovery Protocol (EDP). Apart from this causality relationship, both protocols can be considered 
independent. 
Implementations may choose to support multiple PDPs and EDPs, possibly vendor-specific. As long as two 
Participants have at least one PDP and EDP in common, they can exchange the required discovery information. 
For the purpose of interoperability, all RTPS implementations must provide at least the following discovery 
protocols: 
1. Simple Participant Discovery Protocol (SPDP) 
2. Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol (SEDP) 
Both are basic discovery protocols that suffice for small to medium scale networks. Additional PDPs and EDPs 
that are geared towards larger networks may be added to future versions of the specification. 
Finally, the role of a discovery protocol is to provide information on discovered remote Endpoints. How this 
information is used by a Participant to configure its local Endpoints depends on the actual implementation of 
the RTPS protocol and is not part of the discovery protocol specification. For example, for the reference 
implementations introduced in 8.4.7, the information obtained on the remote Endpoints allows the 
implementation to configure: 
• The RTPS ReaderLocator objects that are associated with each RTPS StatelessWriter. 
• The RTPS ReaderProxy objects associated with each RTPS StatefulWriter. 
• The RTPS WriterProxy objects associated with each RTPS StatefulReader. 
The Discovery Module is organized as follows: 
• The SPDP and SEDP rely on pre-defined RTPS built-in Writer and Reader Endpoints to exchange 
discovery information. 8.5.2 introduces these RTPS built-in Endpoints. 
• The SPDP is discussed in 8.5.3. 
• The SEDP is discussed in 8.5.4. 
8.5.2 
RTPS Built-in Discovery Endpoints 
The DDS specification specifies that discovery takes place using “built-in” DDS DataReaders and DataWriters 
with pre- defined Topics and QoS. 
There are four pre-defined built-in Topics: “DCPSParticipant,” “DCPSSubscription,” “DCPSPublication,” and 
“DCPSTopic.” The DataTypes associated with these Topics are also specified by the DDS specification and 
mainly contain Entity QoS values. 
For each of the built-in Topics, there exists a corresponding DDS built-in DataWriter and DDS built-in 
DataReader. The built-in DataWriters are used to announce the presence and QoS of the local DDS Participant 
and the DDS Entities it contains (DataReaders, DataWriters and Topics) to the rest of the network. Likewise, 
the built-in DataReaders collect this information from remote Participants, which is then used by the DDS 
implementation to identify matching remote Entities. The built-in DataReaders act as regular DDS DataReaders 
and can also be accessed by the user through the DDS API. 
The approach taken by the RTPS Simple Discovery Protocols (SPDP and SEDP) is analogous to the built-in 
Entity concept. RTPS maps each built-in DDS DataWriter or DataReader to an associated built-in RTPS 
Endpoint. These built- in Endpoints act as regular Writer and Reader Endpoints and provide the means to 
exchange the required discovery information between Participants using the regular RTPS protocol defined in 
the Behavior Module. 
The SPDP, which concerns itself with how Participants discover each other, maps the DDS built-in Entities for 
the “DCPSParticipant” Topic. The SEDP, which specifies how to exchange discovery information on local 
Topics, DataWriters and DataReaders, maps the DDS built-in Entities for the “DCPSSubscription,” 
“DCPSPublication” and “DCPSTopic” Topics.

8.5.3 
The Simple Participant Discovery Protocol 
The purpose of a PDP is to discover the presence of other Participants on the network and their properties. 
A Participant may support multiple PDPs, but for the purpose of interoperability, all implementations must 
support at least the Simple Participant Discovery Protocol. 
8.5.3.1 
General Approach 
The RTPS Simple Participant Discovery Protocol (SPDP) uses a simple approach to announce and detect the 
presence of Participants in a domain. 
For each Participant, the SPDP creates two RTPS built-in Endpoints: the SPDPbuiltinParticipantWriter and the 
SPDPbuiltinParticipantReader. 
The SPDPbuiltinParticipantWriter is an RTPS Best-Effort StatelessWriter. The HistoryCache of the 
SPDPbuiltinParticipantWriter contains a single data-object of type SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData. The value 
of this data-object is set from the attributes in the Participant. If the attributes change, the data-object is 
replaced. 
The SPDPbuiltinParticipantWriter periodically sends this data-object to a pre-configured list of locators to 
announce the Participant’s presence on the network. This is achieved by periodically calling 
StatelessWriter::unsent_changes_reset, which causes the StatelessWriter to resend all changes present in its 
HistoryCache to all locators. The periodic rate at which the SPDPbuiltinParticipantWriter sends out the 
SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData defaults to a PSM specified value. This period should be smaller than the 
leaseDuration specified in the SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData (see also 8.5.3.3.2). 
The pre-configured list of locators may include both unicast and multicast locators. Port numbers are defined by 
each PSM. These locators simply represent possible remote Participants in the network, no Participant need 
actually be present. By sending the SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData periodically, Participants can join the 
network in any order. 
The SPDPbuiltinParticipantReader receives the SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData announcements from the 
remote Participants. The contained information includes what Endpoint Discovery Protocols the remote 
Participant supports. The proper Endpoint Discovery Protocol is then used for exchanging Endpoint information 
with the remote Participant. 
Implementations can minimize any start-up delays by sending an additional SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData in 
response to receiving this data-object from a previously unknown Participant, but this behavior is optional. 
Implementations may also enable the user to choose whether to automatically extend the pre-configured list of 
locators with new locators from newly discovered Participants. This enables asymmetric locator lists. These last 
two features are optional and not required for the purpose of interoperability. 
8.5.3.2 
SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData 
The SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData defines the data exchanged as part of the SPDP. 
Figure 8.27 illustrates the contents of the SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData. As shown in the figure, the 
SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData specializes the ParticipantProxy and therefore includes all the information 
necessary to configure a discovered Participant. The SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData also specializes the 
DDS-defined DDS::ParticipantBuiltinTopicData providing the information the corresponding DDS built-in 
DataReader needs.

As mentioned in 8.5.3.1, the SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData lists the Endpoint Discovery Protocols supported 
by the Participant. The attributes shown in Table 8.78 only reflect the mandatory SEDP. There are currently no 
other Endpoint Discovery Protocols defined by the RTPS specification. In order to extend 
SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData to include additional EDPs, the standard RTPS extension mechanisms can be 
used. Please refer to 9.6.3 for additional information. 
 
The availableBuiltinEndpoints attribute 
The SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData provides information about the builtin endpoints supported by the 
Participant. This information is contained in the availableBuiltinEndpoints attribute. 
The builtin endpoints that may be announced in the availableBuiltinEndpoints include: 
PUBLICATIONS_DETECTOR, PUBLICATIONS_ANNOUNCER, SUBSCRIPTIONS_DETECTOR, 
SUBSCRIPTIONS_ANNOUNCER, TOPICS_DETECTOR, TOPICS_ANNOUNCER, 
PARTICIPANT_MESSAGE_READER, and PARTICIPANT_MESSAGE_WRITER. 
The availableBuiltinEndpoints may also announce builtin endpoints defined in other DDS specifications. See

The HistoryCache of the SPDPbuiltinParticipantReader contains information on all active discovered 
participants; the key used to identify each data-object corresponds to the Participant GUID. 
Each time information on a participant is received by the SPDPbuiltinParticipantReader, the SPDP examines 
the HistoryCache looking for an entry with a key that matches the Participant GUID. If an entry with a matching 
key is not there, a new entry is added keyed by the GUID of the Participant. 
Periodically, the SPDP examines the SPDPbuiltinParticipantReader HistoryCache looking for stale entries 
defined as those that have not been refreshed for a period longer than their specified leaseDuration. Stale entries 
are removed. 
8.5.3.4 
Logical ports used by the Simple Participant Discovery Protocol 
As mentioned above, each SPDPbuiltinParticipantWriter uses a pre-configured list of locators to announce a 
Participant’s presence on the network. 
In order to enable plug-and-play interoperability, the pre-configured list of locators must use the following well-
known logical ports:

8.5.4 
The Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol 
An Endpoint Discovery Protocol defines the required information exchange between two Participants in order 
to discover each other’s Writer and Reader Endpoints. 
A Participant may support multiple EDPs, but for the purpose of interoperability, all implementations must 
support at least the Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol. 
8.5.4.1 
General Approach 
Similar to the SPDP, the Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol uses pre-defined built-in Endpoints. The use of 
pre-defined built-in Endpoints means that once a Participant knows of the presence of another Participant, it 
can assume the presence of the built-in Endpoints made available by the remote participant and establish the 
association with the locally-matching built-in Endpoints. 
The protocol used to communicate between built-in Endpoints is the same as used for application-defined 
Endpoints. Therefore, by reading the built-in Reader Endpoints, the protocol virtual machine can discover the 
presence and QoS of the DDS Entities that belong to any remote Participants. Similarly, by writing the built-in 
Writer Endpoints a Participant can inform the other Participants of the existence and QoS of local DDS 
Entities. 
The use of built-in topics in the SEDP therefore reduces the scope of the overall discovery protocol to the 
determination of which Participants are present in the system and the attribute values for the ReaderProxy and 
WriterProxy objects that correspond to the built-in Endpoints of these Participants. Once that is known, 
everything else results from the application of the RTPS protocol to the communication between the built-in 
RTPS Readers and Writers. 
8.5.4.2 
The built-in Endpoints used by the Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol 
The SEDP maps the DDS built-in Entities for the “DCPSSubscription,” “DCPSPublication,” and “DCPSTopic” 
Topics. According to the DDS specification, the reliability QoS for these built-in Entities is set to ‘reliable.’ The 
SEDP therefore maps each corresponding built-in DDS DataWriter or DataReader into corresponding reliable 
RTPS Writer and Reader Endpoints. 
For example, as illustrated in Figure 8.29, the DDS built-in DataWriters for the “DCPSSubscription,” 
“DCPSPublication,” and “DCPSTopic” Topics can be mapped to reliable RTPS StatefulWriters and the 
corresponding DDS built-in DataReaders to reliable RTPS StatefulReaders. Actual implementations need not 
use the stateful reference implementation. For the purpose of interoperability, it is sufficient that an 
implementation provides the required built-in Endpoints and reliable communication that satisfies the general 
requirements listed in 8.4.2. 
 
Figure 8.29 - Example mapping of the DDS Built-in Entities to corresponding RTPS built-in Endpoints 
The RTPS Protocol reserves the following values of the EntityId_t for the built-in Endpoints:

## Page 131

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
125 
 
 
ENTITYID_SEDP_BUILTIN_PUBLICATIONS_ANNOUNCER 
ENTITYID_SEDP_BUILTIN_PUBLICATIONS_DETECTOR 
ENTITYID_SEDP_BUILTIN_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ANNOUNCER 
ENTITYID_SEDP_BUILTIN_SUBSCRIPTIONS_DETECTOR 
ENTITYID_SEDP_BUILTIN_TOPICS_ANNOUNCER ENTITYID_SEDP_BUILTIN_TOPICS_DETECTOR 
The actual value for the reserved EntityId_t is defined by each PSM. 
8.5.4.3 
Built-in Endpoints required by the Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol 
Implementations are not required to provide all built-in Endpoints. 
As mentioned in the DDS specification, Topic propagation is optional. Therefore, it is not required to 
implement the SEDPbuiltinTopicsReader and SEDPbuiltinTopicsWriter built-in Endpoints and for the purpose 
of interoperability, implementations should not rely on their presence in remote Participants. 
As far as the remaining built-in Endpoints are concerned, a Participant is only required to provide the built-in 
Endpoints required for matching up local and remote Endpoints. For example, if a DDS Participant will only 
contain DDS DataWriters, the only required RTPS built-in Endpoints are the SEDPbuiltinPublicationsWriter 
and the SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsReader. The SEDPbuiltinPublicationsReader and the 
SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsWriter built-in Endpoints serve no purpose in this case. 
The SPDP specifies how a Participant informs other Participants about what built-in Endpoints it has available. 
This is discussed in 8.5.3.2. 
8.5.4.4 
Data Types associated with built-in Endpoints used by the Simple Endpoint 
Discovery Protocol 
Each RTPS Endpoint has a HistoryCache that stores changes to the data-objects associated with the Endpoint. 
This also applies to the RTPS built-in Endpoints. Therefore, each RTPS built-in Endpoint depends on some 
DataType that represents the logical contents of the data written into its HistoryCache. 
Figure 8.30 defines the DiscoveredWriterData, DiscoveredReaderData, and DiscoveredTopicData DataTypes 
associated with the RTPS built-in Endpoints for the “DCPSPublication,” “DCPSSubscription,” and 
“DCPSTopic” Topics. The DataType associated with the “DCPSParticipant” Topic is defined in 8.5.3.2. 
The DataType associated with each RTPS built-in Endpoint contains all the information specified by DDS for 
the corresponding built-in DDS Entity. For this reason, DiscoveredReaderData extends the DDS-defined 
DDS::SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData, DiscoveredWriterData extends DDS::PublicationBuiltinTopicData, and 
DiscoveredTopicData extends DDS::TopicBuiltinTopicData. 
In addition to the data needed by the associated built-in DDS Entities, the “Discovered” DataTypes also include 
all the information that may be needed by an implementation of the protocol to configure the RTPS Endpoints. 
This information is contained in the RTPS ReaderProxy and WriterProxy.

Figure 8.30 - Data types associated with built-in Endpoints used by the Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol 
An implementation of the protocol need not necessarily send all information contained in the DataTypes. If any 
information is not present, the implementation can assume the default values, as defined by the PSM. The PSM 
also defines how the discovery information is represented on the wire. 
The RTPS built-in Endpoints used by the SEDP and their associated DataTypes are shown in Figure 8.31.

Figure 8.31 - Built-in Endpoints and the DataType associated with their respective HistoryCache 
The contents of the HistoryCache for each built-in Endpoint can be described in terms of the following aspects: 
DataType, Cardinality, Data-object insertion, Data-object modification, and Data-object deletion. 
• 
DataType. The type of the data stored in the cache. This is partly defined by the DDS 
specification. 
• 
Cardinality. The number of different data-objects (each with a different key) that can potentially 
be stored in the cache. 
• 
Data-object insertion. Conditions under which a new data-object is inserted into the cache. 
• 
Data-object modification. Conditions under which the value of an existing data-object is 
modified. 
• 
Data-object deletion. Conditions under which an existing data-object is removed from the cache. 
It is illustrative to describe the HistoryCache for each of the built-in Endpoints.

Interaction with the RTPS virtual machine 
To further illustrate the SPDP and SEDP, this specification describes how the information provided by the SPDP 
can be used to configure the SEDP built-in Endpoints in the RTPS virtual machine. 
8.5.5.1 
Discovery of a new remote Participant 
Using the SPDPbuiltinParticipantReader, a local Participant ‘local_participant’ discovers the existence of 
another Participant described by the DiscoveredParticipantData participant_data. The discovered 
Participant uses the SEDP. 
The pseudo code below configures the local SEDP built-in Endpoints within local_participant to communicate 
with the corresponding SEDP built-in Endpoints in the discovered Participant. 
Note that how the Endpoints are configured depends on the implementation of the protocol. For the stateful 
reference implementation, this operation performs the following logical steps: 
// Check that the domainId of the discovered participant equals the local one. 
// If it is not equal then there the local endpoints are not configured to  
// communicate with the discovered participant. 
IF ( participant_data.domainId != local_participant.domainId ) THEN 
   RETURN;

ENDIF  
// Check that the domainTag of the discovered participant equals the local one. 
// If it is not equal then there the local endpoints are not configured to  
// communicate with the discovered participant. 
IF ( !STRING_EQUAL(participant_data.domainTag, local_participant.domainTag) ) 
THEN 
   RETURN; 
ENDIF 
IF ( PUBLICATIONS_DETECTOR IS_IN participant_data.availableEndpoints ) THEN

8.5.5.2 
Removal of a previously discovered Participant 
Based on the remote Participant’s leaseDuration, a local Participant ‘local_participant’ concludes that a 
previously discovered Participant with GUID_t participant_guid is no longer present. The Participant 
‘local_participant’ must reconfigure any local Endpoints that were communicating with Endpoints in the 
Participant identified by the GUID_t participant_guid. 
For the stateful reference implementation, this operation performs the following logical steps: 
guid = <participant_guid.guidPrefix, 
                         ENTITYID_SEDP_BUILTIN_PUBLICATIONS_DETECTOR>;

8.5.6 
Supporting Alternative Discovery Protocols 
The requirements on the Participant and Endpoint Discovery Protocols may vary depending on the deployment 
scenario. For example, a protocol optimized for speed and simplicity (such as a protocol that would be deployed 
in embedded devices on a LAN) may not scale well to large systems in a WAN environment. 
For this reason, the RTPS specification allows implementations to support multiple PDPs and EDPs. There are 
many possible approaches to implementing a Discovery Protocol including the use of static discovery, file-
based discovery, a central look-up service, etc. The only requirement imposed by RTPS for the purpose of 
interoperability is that all RTPS implementations support at least the SPDP and SEDP. It is expected that over 
time, a collection of interoperable Discovery Protocols will be developed to address specific deployment 
needs. 
If an implementation supports multiple PDPs, each PDP may be initialized differently and discover a different 
set of remote Participants. Remote Participants using a different vendor’s RTPS implementation must be 
contacted using at least the SPDP to ensure interoperability. There is no such requirement when the remote 
Participant uses the same RTPS implementation.

## Page 137

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
131 
 
 
Even when the SPDP is used by all Participants, remote Participants may still use different EDPs. Which EDPs 
a Participant supports is included in the information exchanged by the SPDP. All Participants must support at 
least the SEDP, so they always have at least one EDP in common. However, if two Participants both support 
another EDP, this alternative protocol can be used instead. In that case, there is no need to create the SEDP 
built-in Endpoints, or if they already exist, no need to configure them to match the new remote Participant. This 
approach enables a vendor to customize the EDP if desired without compromising interoperability. 
8.6 
Versioning and Extensibility 
Implementations of this version of the RTPS protocol should be able to process RTPS Messages not only with 
the same major version but possibly higher minor versions. 
8.6.1 
Allowed Extensions within this major Version 
Within this major version, future minor versions of the protocol can augment the protocol in the following 
ways: 
• 
Additional Submessages with other submessageIds can be introduced and used anywhere in an 
RTPS Message. An implementation should skip over unknown Submessages using the 
submessageLength field in the SubmessageHeader. 
• 
Additional fields can be added to the end of a Submessage that was already defined in the current 
minor version. An implementation should skip over additional fields using the 
submessageLength field in the SubmessageHeader. 
• 
Additional built-in Endpoints with new IDs can be added. An implementation should ignore any 
unknown built-in Endpoints.Additional parameters with new parameterIds can be added. An 
implementation should ignore any unknown parameters. 
All such changes require an increase of the minor version number. 
8.6.2 
What cannot change within this major Version 
The following items cannot be changed within the same major version: 
• 
A Submessage cannot be deleted. 
• 
A Submessage cannot be modified except as described in 8.6.1. 
• 
The meaning of submessageIds cannot be modified. 
All such changes require an increase in the major version number. 
8.7 
Implementing DDS QoS and advanced DDS features using 
RTPS 
The RTPS protocol and its extension mechanisms provide the core functionality required to implement DDS. 
This sub clause defines how to use RTPS to implement the DDS QoS parameters. 
In addition, this sub clause defines the RTPS protocol extensions required for implementing the following 
advanced DDS features: 
• Content-filtered Topics, see 8.7.3 
• Instance State Changes 8.7.4 
• Group Ordered Access, see 8.7.5 
• Coherent Sets, see 8.7.6 
All extensions are based on the standard extension mechanisms provided by RTPS. 
This sub clause forms a normative part of the specification for the purpose of interoperability.

8.7.1 
Adding in-line Parameters to Data Submessages 
Data and DataFrag Submessages optionally contain a ParameterList SubmessageElement for storing 
in-line QoS parameters and other information. 
In case a Reader does not keep a list of matching remote Writers or the QoS parameters they were configured 
with (i.e., is a stateless Reader), a Data Submessage with in-line QoS parameters contains all the information 
needed to enable the Reader to apply all Writer-specific QoS parameters. 
A stateless Reader’s need for receiving in-line QoS to get information on remote Writers is the justification for 
requiring a Writer to send in-line QoS if the Reader requests them (8.4.2.2.2). 
For immutable QoS, all RxO QoS are sent in-line to allow a stateless Reader to reject samples in case of 
incompatible QoS. Mutable QoS relevant to the Reader are sent in-line so they may take effect immediately, 
regardless of the amount of state kept on the Reader. Note that a stateful Reader has the option of relying on its 
cached information of remote Writers rather than the received in-line QoS. 
A stateless Reader uses the discovery protocol to announce to remote Writers that it expects to receive QoS 
parameters in-line, as discussed in the Discovery Module (8.5). If in-line QoS parameters are expected, 
implementations must also include the topic name as an in-line parameter. This ensures that on the receiving 
side, the Submessage can be passed to all Readers for that topic, including the stateless Readers. 
Independent of whether Readers expect in-line QoS parameters, a Data Submessage may also contain in-line 
parameters related to coherent sets and content-filtered topics. This is described in more detail in the sub clauses 
that follow. 
For improved performance, stateful implementations may ignore in-line QoS and instead rely solely on cached 
values obtained through Discovery. Note that not parsing in-line QoS may delay the point in time when a new 
QoS takes effect, as it first must be propagated through Discovery.

In-line DDS QoS Parameters 
Table 8.85 lists the standard DDS QoS parameters that may appear in-line. 
If a Reader expects to receive in-line QoS parameters and any of these QoS parameters are missing, it will 
assume the default value for that QoS parameter, where the default is defined by DDS. 
In-line parameters are added to data submessages to make them self-describing. In order to achieve self-
describing messages, not only the parameters defined in Table 8.85 have to be sent with the submessage, but 
also a parameter TOPIC_NAME. This parameter contains the name of the topic that the submessage belongs to. 
8.7.2.2 
DDS QoS Parameters that affect the wire protocol 
 
DURABILITY 
While volatile and transient-local durability do not affect the RTPS protocol, support for transient and persistent 
durability may. This is not covered in the current version of the specification. 
 
PRESENTATION 
Sub clause 8.7.5 defines how to implement the GROUP ordered access policy of the PRESENTATION QoS.  
Sub clause 8.7.6 defines how to implement the coherent access policy of the PRESENTATION QoS. The other 
aspects of this QoS do not affect the RTPS protocol. 
 
LIVELINESS 
Implementations must follow the approaches below: 
• 
DDS_AUTOMATIC_LIVELINESS_QOS : liveliness is maintained through the 
BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter. For a given Participant, in order to maintain the liveliness of 
its Writer Entities with LIVELINESS QoS set to AUTOMATIC, implementations must refresh 
the Participant’s liveliness (i.e., send the ParticipantMessageData, see (8.4.13.5) at a rate faster 
than the smallest lease duration among the Writers. 
• 
DDS_MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT_LIVELINESS_QOS : liveliness is maintained through 
the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter. If the Participant has any 
MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT Writers, implementations must check periodically to see if 
write(), assert_liveliness(), dispose(), or unregister_instance() was called for any of them. The 
period for this check equals the smallest lease duration among the Writers. If any of the 
operations were called, implementations must refresh the Participant’s liveliness (i.e., send the 
ParticipantMessageData, see 8.4.13.5).

## Page 140

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
134
• 
DDS_MANUAL_BY_TOPIC_LIVELINESS_QOS : liveliness is maintained by sending data or 
an explicit Heartbeat message with liveliness flag set. The standard RTPS Messages that 
result from calling write(), dispose(), or unregister_instance() on a Writer Entity suffice to assert  
the liveliness of a Writer with LIVELINESS QoS set to MANUAL_BY_TOPIC. When 
assert_liveliness() is called, the Writer must send a Heartbeat Message with final flag and 
liveliness flag set. 
 
TIME_BASED_FILTER 
Implementations may optimize bandwidth usage by applying a time-based filter on the Writer side. That way, 
data that would be dropped on the Reader side is never sent. 
When one or more data updates are filtered out on the Writer side, implementations must send a Gap 
Submessage instead, indicating which samples were filtered out. This Submessage must be sent before the next 
update and notifies the Reader the missing updates were filtered out and not simply lost. 
 
RELIABILITY 
Implementations must meet the reliable RTPS protocol requirements for interoperability, defined in 8.4.2. 
 
DESTINATION_ORDER 
In order to implement the DDS_BY_SOURCE_TIMESTAMP_DESTINATIONORDER_QOS policy, 
implementations must include an InfoTimestamp Submessage with every update from a Writer. 
 
WRITER_DATA_LIFECYCLE 
If autodispose_unregistered_instances is enabled, Data Messages that unregister an instance must also 
dispose it. This restricts the allowable values of the DisposedFlag and UnregisteredFlag flags. 
8.7.3 
Content-filtered Topics 
Content-filtered topics make it possible for a DDS DataReader to request the middleware to filter out data 
samples based on their contents. 
When filtering on the Reader side only, samples which do not pass the filter are simply dropped by the 
middleware. In this case, no further extensions to RTPS are needed. 
In many cases, implementations will benefit from filtering on the Writer side, in addition to filtering on the 
Reader side. When filtering on the Writer side, a sample that does not pass a Reader side filter may sometimes 
not be sent to that Reader. This conserves bandwidth.  
In order to support Writer side filtering, standard RTPS extension mechanisms are used to: 
• 
Include Reader filter information during the Endpoint discovery phase. 
• 
Include filter results with each data sample. 
The Writer may indicate to a Reader that a Sample has been filtered due to the application of the reader-
specified content filter by sending a directed Data message that includes only the key information 
(DataFlag=0), indicating in the Inline Qos that the instance state is ALIVE_FILTERED. See 8.7.3.2. The 
Reader may use this information to transition the specified instance to InstanceState ALIVE_FILTERED. 
The Writer may indicate to a Reader that it has applied a set of filters to a Sample and the corresponding result 
by including the ContentFilteredInfo_t into the Data message, see 8.7.3.3. Readers can use 
ContentFilteredInfo_t to determine whether their filter has been already applied by the Writer and avoid having 
to apply the filter again. 
Alternatively, the Writer may not send a Data message at all. This is only allowed if the previous sample for 
that Instance was already filtered for that Reader, see 8.7.4.

8.7.3.1 
Exchanging filter information using the built-in Endpoints 
Content-filtered topics are defined on the Reader side. In order to implement Writer side filtering, information 
on the filter used by a given Reader must be propagated to matching remote Writers. This requires extending the 
data type associated with RTPS built-in Endpoints. 
As illustrated in Figure 8.31, the data types associated with RTPS built-in Endpoints extend the DDS built-in 
topic data types, which include all relevant QoS. Since DDS does not define content-filtered topics as a Reader 
QoS policy (instead, DDS defines separate Content-filtered Topics), RTPS adds an additional 
ContentFilterProperty_t field to DiscoveredReaderData, defined in Table 8.86. 
Table 8.86 - Content filter property 
ContentFilterProperty_t 
attribute 
type 
value 
contentFilteredTopicName 
string 
Name of the Content-filtered Topic associated 
with the Reader. 
Must have non-zero length. 
relatedTopicName 
string 
Name of the Topic related to the Content-
filtered Topic. Must have non-zero length. 
filterClassName 
string 
Identifies the filter class this filter belongs 
to. RTPS can support multiple filter classes 
(SQL, regular expressions, custom filters, 
etc). 
Must have non-zero length. 
RTPS predefines the following values: 
“DDSSQL” Default filter class name if none  
specified. Matches the SQL filter specified by 
DDS, which must be available in all 
implementations. 
filterExpression 
string 
The actual filter expression. Must be a valid 
expression for the filter class specified using 
filterClassName. 
Must have non-zero length. 
expressionParameters 
stringSequence 
Defines the value for each parameter in the 
filter expression. Can have zero length if the 
filter expression contains no parameters. 
The ContentFilterProperty_t field provides all the required information to enable content filtering on the Writer 
side. For example, for the default DDSSQL filter class, a valid filter expression for a data type containing 
members a, b and c could be “(a < 5) AND (b == %0) AND (c >= %1)” with expression parameters “5” and 
“3.” In order for the Writer to apply the filter, it must have been configured to handle filters of the specified 
filter class. If not, the Writer will simply ignore the filter information and not filter any data samples. 
DDS allows the user to modify the filter expression parameters at run-time. Each time the parameters are 
modified, the updated information is exchanged using the Endpoint discovery protocol. This is identical to 
updating a mutable QoS value. 
8.7.3.2 
Indicating to a Reader that a Sample has been filtered 
There are situations when a Writer needs to communicate to a Reader that a sample was written but it does not 
pass the reader-specified Content Filter. When this happens, the Writer can use a Data submessage that does not 
contain a Data payload (DataFlag=0) and sets FilteredFlag=1, see 8.3.8.2.2.

## Page 142

DDSI-RTPS v2.5

8.7.3.3 
Including in-line filter results with each data sample 
In general, when applying filtering on the Writer side, a sample is not sent if it does not pass the remote 
Reader’s filter. In that case, the Data submessage is replaced by a Gap submessage. This ensures the sample 
is not considered ‘lost’ on the Reader side. This approach matches that of applying a time-based filter on the 
Writer side. The remainder of the discussion only refers to Data Submessages, but the same approach is 
followed for DataFrag Submessages. 
In some cases, it may still be possible for a Reader to receive a sample that did not pass its filter, for example 
when sending data using multicast. Another use case is multiple Readers belonging to the same Participant. In 
that case, the Writer need only send a single RTPS message, destined to ENTITYID_UNKNOWN (see 
8.4.15.5). Each Reader may use a different filter however, in which case the Writer needs to apply multiple 
filters before sending the sample. 
In both use cases, two options exist: 
1. The sample passes none of the filters for any of the remote Readers. In that case, the Data 
submessage is again replaced by a Gap submessage. 
2. The sample passes some or all of the filters. In that case, the sample must still be sent and the 
writer must include information with the Data submessage on what filters were applied and 
the according result. 
The inlineQos element of the Data submessage is used to include the necessary filter information. More 
specifically, a new parameter is added, containing the information shown in Table 8.87. 
Table 8.87 - Content filter info associated with a data sample 
ContentFilterInfo_t 
attribute 
type 
value 
filterResult 
FilterResult_t 
For each filter signature, the results indicate 
whether the sample passed the filter. 
filterSignatures 
FilterSignature_t[] 
A list of filters that were applied to the sample. 
A filter signature FilterSignature_t uniquely identifies a filter and is based on the filter properties listed in 
Table 8.86. How to represent and calculate a filter signature is defined by the PSM. Whether the sample passed 
the filters that were applied on the Writer side is encoded by the filterResult_t attribute, again defined by the 
PSM. 
Note that a filter signature changes when the filter’s expression parameters change. Until it receives updated 
parameter values, a Writer side filter may be using outdated expression parameters, in which case the in-line 
filter signature will not match the signature expected by the Reader. As a result, the Reader will ignore the filter 
results and instead apply its local filter. 
8.7.3.4 
Requirements for Interoperability 
Writer side filtering constitutes an optimization and is optional, so it is not required for interoperability. Samples 
will always be filtered on the Reader side if: 
• 
The Writer side did not apply any filtering. 
• 
The Writer side did not apply the filter expected by the Reader. As mentioned earlier, this may 
occur if the Writer has not yet been informed about updated filter parameters. 
• 
The Reader side does not support Writer side filtering (and therefore ignores in-line filter 
information).  
Likewise, Writers may not filter samples because:

## Page 143

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
137 
 
 
• 
The implementation does not support Content-filtered Topics (in which case the filter properties 
of the Reader are ignored). 
• 
The Reader's filter information was rejected (e.g., unrecognized filter class). If an 
implementation supports Content-filtered Topics, it must at least recognize the “DDSSQL” filter 
class, as mandated by the DDS specification. For all other filter classes, both implementations 
must allow the user to register the same custom filter class. 
• 
Other implementation-specific restrictions, such as a resource limit on the number of remote 
readers each writer is able to store filter information for. 
Even if the Writer is performing writer-side filtering, the Writer must provide enough information for the 
Reader to correctly transition the instance state to ALIVE_FILTERED. This means that even if a Sample does 
not pass the reader filter, the Writer must still send a Data submessage unless it the previous sample for that 
Instance also did not pass the content filter. See 8.7.3.2. 
This requirement effectively means that a Writer needs maintain state per Instance and per “content filtered” 
Reader. In this state it must remember whether the last sample written to that Instance passed the reader filter. 
8.7.4 
Changes in the Instance State 
A DDS DataWriter may register data object instances (operation register_instance), update their value 
(operation write), dispose data-object instances (operation dispose), and unregister them (operation 
unregister_instance). When the value of an instance is updated, the new value may not pass the content filter 
specified by a subset of the DataReaders. 
Each one of these operations may cause notifications to be dispatched to the matched DDS DataReaders. The 
DDS DataReader can determine the nature of the change by inspecting the InstanceState instance_state field in 
the SampleInfo that is returned on the DDS DataReader read or take call. 
RTPS uses regular Data Submessages and the in-line QoS parameter extension mechanism to communicate 
instance state changes. The serialized information within the inline QoS contains the new InstanceState, that is, 
whether the instance has been registered, unregistered, or disposed. The actual details depend on the PSM 
(e.g., 9.6.4.4). 
When RTPS sends a Data Submessage to communicate instance state changes it may include only the Key of 
the Data-Object within the SerializedPayload submessage element (see 8.3.8.2). This is because the Key is 
sufficient to uniquely identify the Data-Object instance to which the InstanceState change applies. 
An implementation of RTPS is not required to propagate registration changes until the DDS DataWriter writes 
the first value for that Data-Object instance. 
If a DataWriter updates the value of an instance (operation write), the updated value may not pass the content 
filter specified by one (or more) matched DataReaders. In this situation, there are two possibilities:  
1. If the previous update to the instance passed the filter, then the Writer must send a Data Submessage 
that either includes the data value, or else indicates the InstanceState is ALIVE_FILTERED. See 
9.6.4.5. 
2. If the previous update to the instance did not pass the filter, then the Writer may omit sending the 
Data Submessage to the Reader. 
The rules above ensure the Writer provides enough information for the Reader to transition the instance state to 
ALIVE_FILTERED. 
If a DataWriter disposes an instance (operation dispose) or unregisters an instance (operation unregister), there 
are several possibilities which dictate whether the Writer must send a Data Submessage that indicates the 
InstanceState is NOT_ALIVE_DISPOSED or NOT_ALIVE_NO_WRITERS, respectively. This so called 
“dispose/unregister message” shall be sent if any of the following conditions is met:

## Page 144

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
138
1. The Reader does not have a Content Filter. 
2. The Writer has previously sent a Data message to the Reader for that same instance. 
3. The Reader has OWNERSHIP QosPolicy kind EXCLUSIVE and the Reader Filter is such that there 
could be some values for the Instance that pass the filter. 
In all other cases, the “instance state change” message may be omitted as an optimization. 
These conditions ensure that the Reader is able to determine consistently the ownership and InstanceState for 
the instance. 
8.7.5 
Group Ordered Access 
The DDS Specification provides the functionality for CacheChanges made by DataWriter entities attached to 
the same Publisher object to be made available to subscribers in the same order they occur. 
In order to support group ordered access, RTPS uses the in-line QoS parameter extension mechanism to include 
additional information with each CacheChange. The additional information denotes ordering within the scope 
of the Publisher, as well as the identity of the Writers belonging to the Publisher. 
• 
PID_GROUP_SEQ_NUM to contain the group sequence number. 
• 
PID_WRITER_GROUP_INFO to contain the WriterGroupInfo_t defined in Table 8.88. 
Table 8.88 – Group Writer Info associated with a data sample 
WriterGroupInfo_t 
attribute 
type 
value 
writerSet 
GroupDigest_t 
Identifies the set of Writer EntityIds that are announced in the 
DiscoveredWriterData that belonged to the Publisher at the 
time the sample was written. 
When a Publisher is configured with access scope GROUP, all Data submessages and the first DataFrag 
submessage from any Writer within the Publisher are accompanied with a GROUP sequence number sent as 
part of the in-line QoS. The GROUP sequence number is a strictly monotonically increasing sequence number 
originating from the Publisher. Each time that a DataWriter attached to a Publisher makes a CacheChange 
(i.e., increments its own Writer sequence number), the GROUP sequence number is incremented. 
A DataReader attached to a Subscriber configured with access scope GROUP first orders the samples from a 
remote Writer as it would in the cases where access scope GROUP is not set. Once a sample is ready to be 
committed to the DDS DataReader, it will not commit it. Instead, it will hand it off to a HistoryCache of the 
Subscriber where ordering across remote DataWriters belonging to the same Publisher occurs. A sample with 
GROUP sequence number GSN can be committed to the DDS DataReader from the Subscriber’s history cache 
if any of the following conditions apply: 
• 
GSN-1 has been already been committed. 
• 
It has been determined that none of the remote DataWriters that match reliable DataReaders have 
GSN-1. This condition is met when both of the following conditions apply: 
o 
The Subscriber has received a Heartbeat from one of the DataWriters with 
Heartbeat.currentGSN.value >= GSN and the Heartbeat.writerSet (and 
Heartbeat.secureWriterSet) matches the set of discovered DataWriters.

## Page 145

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
139 
 
 
o 
AND for every matched DataWriter belonging to the Publisher that matches a reliable 
DataReader, the DataWriter has: 
▪ 
Either advanced past the GSN-1 (by committing a Data sample with 
Data.inlineQos.groupSequenceNumber >= GSN) to the Subscriber history cache or 
a Gap message with Gap.gapEndGSN.value >= GSN-1 
▪ 
OR announced it does not have the GSN-1 by sending a Heartbeat with 
Heartbeat.currentGSN.value >= GSN and GSN-1 ∉ [_Heartbeat.firstGSN.value_, 
_Heartbeat.lastGSN.value_] 
The above rules should only take into consideration DataWriters that have not lost their liveliness, see 8.7.2.2.3. 
Implementations could use additional timeout-based rules to limit delays. 
8.7.6 
Coherent Sets 
The DDS specification provides the functionality to define a set of sample updates as a coherent set. A 
DataReader is only notified of the arrival of new updates once all updates in the coherent set have been 
received. 
A “Publisher coherent set” is defined as the set of all CacheChanges performed by all DataWriters in the 
Publisher delimited by the operations begin_coherent_changes() and 
end_coherent_changes(). 
Resulting from each “Publisher coherent set” there may be one or more “Subscriber coherent sets” defined for 
each Subscriber in the system. What constitutes a “Subscriber coherent set” depends on the PRESENTATION 
access_scope of the Subscriber: 
• 
If the Subscriber has PRESENTATION coherent_access=FALSE then there are no Subscriber 
coherent sets. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as if each individual CacheChange was an 
independent Subscriber coherent set. 
• 
If the Subscriber has PRESENTATION access_scope=INSTANCE or TOPIC then there is a separate 
“Subscriber” coherent set for each DataWriter containing the subset of samples that are written by 
each of the DataWriters in the Publisher. 
• 
If the Subscriber has PRESENTATION access_scope=GROUP then the Subscriber coherent set 
matches the Publisher coherent set. 
A “Subscriber-relevant coherent set” is the subset of changes in the “Subscriber coherent set” that the 
Subscriber must receive in order to consider the coherent set complete. Incomplete coherent sets shall not be 
added to the history of the RTPS DataReaders and the corresponding CacheChanges shall be discarded by the 
Subscriber. 
The “Subscriber-relevant coherent set” is defined as the subset of the “Subscriber coherent change” obtained 
after removing the following CacheChanges: 
• 
Changes that belong to DataWriters that are not matched with corresponding DataReaders in the 
Subscriber. 
• 
Changes that are filtered by content or time. 
Note that samples replaced due to history depth are considered part of the “Subscriber-relevant coherent set” if 
any is not received the coherent set is not complete. Likewise, for samples lost due to the use of best-effort 
protocol or other reasons.

## Page 146

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
140
In order to support coherent sets, RTPS uses the in-line QoS parameter extension mechanism to include 
additional information in-line with each Data Submessage. The additional information denotes membership to 
a particular coherent set. The remainder of the discussion only refers to Data Submessages, but the same 
approach is followed for DataFrag Submessages. 
For access scope TOPIC, all Data Submessages belonging to the same coherent set have strict monotonically 
increasing sequence numbers (as they originated from the same Writer). Therefore, a coherent set is uniquely 
identified by the sequence number of the first sample update belonging to the coherent set. All sample updates 
belonging to the same coherent set contain an in-line QoS parameter with this same sequence number. This 
approach also allows the Reader to easily determine when the coherent set started. 
The end of a Writer’s coherent set is defined by the arrival of one of the following: 
• 
A Data Submessage from this Writer that belongs to a new coherent set. 
• 
A Data Submessage from this Writer that does not contain a coherent set in-line QoS parameter 
or alternatively, contains a coherent set in-line QoS parameter with value 
SEQUENCENUMBER_UNKNOWN. Both approaches are equivalent. 
Note that a Data Submessage need not necessarily contain serializedPayload. This makes it possible to notify 
the Reader about the end of a coherent set before the next data is written by the Writer.  
For access scope GROUP, all Data submessages and the first DataFrag submessage belonging to the same 
coherent set have strictly monotonically increasing group sequence numbers (as they originated from the same 
Publisher). Therefore, a group coherent set is uniquely identified by the group sequence number of the first 
sample belonging to the coherent set. All Data submessages and the first DataFrag submessage belonging to 
the same group coherent set shall have three in-line QoS parameters: 
• 
The PID_GROUP_SEQ_NUM shall contain the group sequence number. 
• 
The PID_COHERENT_SET shall contain the sequence number of the first sample update 
belonging to the coherent set from the Writer. 
• 
The PID_GROUP_COHERENT_SET shall contain the group sequence number of the first 
sample update belonging to the coherent set across all Writers within the Publisher. 
A group’s coherent set is marked as being finished by sending an End Coherent Set (ECS) Data submessage 
from all Writers within the Publisher. The ECS Data Submessage shall have the following properties: 
• 
It does not contain a serializedPayload 
• 
Its group sequence number is equal to one greater than the group sequence number of the final 
sample in the group coherent set. 
• 
It is not filtered by time, content, history, lifespan, etc. It can only be removed from the RTPS 
Writer cache when all data samples belonging to the coherent set are removed. 
• 
It does not count towards resource limits. 
• 
It has the InlineQos parameters PID_GROUP_SEQ_NUM, PID_GROUP_COHERENT_SET, 
PID_WRITER_GROUP_INFO. 
• 
If required, it may also contain PID_SECURE_WRITER_GROUP_INFO. See section 9.6.4.5 
for details. 
The ECS Data Submessage is sent with in-line QoS parameters: 
• 
PID_GROUP_SEQ_NUM: The group sequence number one greater than the group sequence 
number of the last sample in the coherent set. 
• 
PID_GROUP_COHERENT_SET: The group sequence number of the coherent set that it marks 
the end of. 
• 
PID_GROUP_WRITER_INFO: The writer group information encoding which writers were 
contained in the Publisher during the time that the coherent set was written. Note that Writers 
are not allowed to be added or removed from a Publisher from the time that a coherent set 
begins until after it ends.

## Page 147

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
141 
 
 
A DataReader that receives samples in a group coherent set first waits for the complete coherent set from each 
remote DataWriter separately. Once a coherent set from a DataWriter is complete, the DataReader commits 
the entire set to the HistoryCache of the Subscriber. The Subscriber orders these individual coherent sets from 
each DataReader according to the same rules that are applied for ordered access with scope set to GROUP. The 
group coherent set becomes ready to be committed to the DDS DataReader once an ECS sample is committed 
to the Subscriber and the ECS sample meets the criteria for being committed to the DDS DataReader. 
Once the group coherent set becomes ready to be committed the Subscriber shall determine if the subscriber-
relevant coherent set is complete and if so, make it available to the application. 
8.7.7 
Directed Write 
Direct peer-to-peer communications where a Writer explicitly identifies a Subset of its matched Readers as the 
intended destination for a particular sample is useful in some application scenarios. 
RTPS supports directed writes by using the in-line QoS parameter extension mechanism. The serialized 
information denotes the GUIDs of the targeted reader(s). 
When a writer sends a directed sample, only recipients with a matching GUID accept the sample; all other 
recipients acknowledge but absorb the sample, as if it were a GAP message. 
8.7.8 
Property Lists 
Property lists are lists of user-definable properties applied to a DDS Entity. An entry in the list is a generic 
name-value pair. A user defines a pair to be a property for a DDS Participant, DataWriter, or DataReader. This 
extensible list enables non-DDS-specified properties to be applied. 
The RTPS protocol supports Property Lists as in-line parameters. Properties can then be propagated during 
Discovery or as in-line QoS. 
8.7.9 
Original Writer Info 
A service supporting the TransientLocal, Transient, or Persistent level of DDS Durability QoS needs to send the 
data that has been received and stored on behalf of the persistent writer. 
This service that forwards messages needs to indicate that the forwarded message belongs to the message-
stream of another writer, such that if the reader receives the same messages from another source (for example, 
another forwarding service or the original writer), it can treat them as duplicates. 
The RTPS protocol supports this forwarding of messages by including information of the original writer. 
When a RTPS Reader receives this information, it will treat it as a normal CacheChange, but once the 
CacheChange is ready to be committed to the DDS DataReader, it will not commit it. Instead, it will hand if off 
to the HistoryCache of the RTPS Reader that is communicating with the RTPS Writer indicated in the 
ORIGINAL_WRITER_INFO in-line QoS and treat is as having the sequence number which appears there.

8.7.10 Key Hash 
The Key Hash provides a hint for the key that uniquely identifies the data-object that is being changed within 
the set of objects that have been registered by the DDS DataWriter. 
Nominally the key is part of the serialized data of a data submessage. Using the key hash benefits 
implementations by providing a faster alternative than deserializing the full key from the received data-object. 
When the key hash is not received by a DataReader, it should be computed from the data itself. If there is no 
data in the submessage, then a default zero-valued key hash should be used by the DataReader. 
A Key Hash, if present, shall be computed as described in 9.6.4.3.

Introduction 
This clause defines the Platform Specific Model (PSM) that maps the Protocol PIM to UDP/IP. The goal for this 
PSM is to provide a mapping with minimal overhead directly on top of UDP/IP. 
The suitability of UDP/IP as a transport for DDS applications stems from several factors: 
• 
Universal availability. Being a core part of the IP stack, UDP/IP is available on virtually all 
operating systems. 
• 
Light-weight. UDP/IP is a very simple protocol that adds minimal services on top of IP. Its use 
enables the use of IP- based networks with the minimal possible overhead. 
• 
Best-effort. UDP/IP provides a best-effort service that maps well to Quality-of-service needs of 
many real-time data streams. In the situations where it is needed, the RTPS protocol provides the 
mechanism to attain reliable delivery on top of the best-effort service provided by UDP. 
• 
Connectionless. UDP/IP offers a connectionless service; this allows multiple RTPS endpoints to 
share a single operating system UDP resource (socket/port) while allowing for interleaving of 
messages effectively providing an out-of- band mechanism for each separate data-stream. 
• 
Predictable behavior. Unlike TCP, UDP does not introduce timers that would cause operations to 
block for varying amounts of time. As such, it is simpler to model the impact of using UDP on a 
real-time application. 
• 
Scalability and multicast support. UDP/IP natively supports multicast which allows efficient 
distribution of a single message to a large number of recipients.

Notational Conventions 
9.2.1 
Name Space 
All the definitions in this document are part of the “RTPS” name-space. To facilitate reading and understanding, 
the name-space prefix has been left out of the definitions and classes in this document. 
9.2.2 
IDL Representation of Structures and CDR Wire Representation 
The following sub clauses often define structures, such as: 
typedef octet OctetArray3[3];  
struct EntityId_t { 
OctetArray3 entityKey;  
octet entityKind; 
}; 
These definitions use the OMG IDL (Interface Definition Language). When these structures are sent on the 
wire, they are encoded using the corresponding CDR representation. 
9.2.3 
Representation of Bits and Bytes 
This document often uses the following notation to represent an octet or byte: 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0| 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
In this notation, the leftmost bit (bit 7) is the most significant bit ("MSB") and the rightmost bit (bit 0) is the 
least significant bit (“LSB”). 
Streams of bytes are ordered per lines of 4 bytes each as follows:

## Page 150

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
144
0...2...........7...............15.............23. ............. 31 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
| first byte 
| 
| 
| 
4th byte 
| 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
-----------stream------------->>>> 
In this representation, the byte that comes first in the stream is on the left. The bit on the extreme left is the 
MSB of the first byte; the bit on the extreme right is the LSB of the 4th byte. 
9.3 
Mapping of the RTPS Types 
9.3.1 
The Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) 
The GUID is an attribute present in all RTPS Entities that uniquely identifies them within the DDS domain (see 
8.2.4.1). The PIM defines the GUID as composed of a GuidPrefix_t prefix capable of holding 12 bytes, and an 
EntityId_t entityId capable of holding 4 bytes. This sub clause defines how the PSM maps those structures. 
9.3.1.1 
Mapping of the GuidPrefix_t 
The PSM maps the GuidPrefix_t to the following structure: 
typedef octet GuidPrefix_t[12]; 
The reserved constant GUIDPREFIX_UNKNOWN defined by the PIM is mapped to: 
#define GUIDPREFIX_UNKNOWN {0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00} 
9.3.1.2 
Mapping of the EntityId_t 
Clause 8.2.4.3 states that the EntityId_t is the unique identification of the Endpoint within the Participant. The 
PSM maps the EntityId_t to the following structure: 
typedef octet OctetArray3[3];  
struct EntityId_t { 
OctetArray3 entityKey;  
octet entityKind; 
}; 
The reserved constant ENTITYID_UNKNOWN defined by the PIM is mapped to: 
#define ENTITYID_UNKNOWN {{0x00, 0x00, 0x00}, 0x00} 
The entityKind field within EntityId_t encodes the kind of Entity (Participant, Reader, Writer, Reader Group, 
Writer Group) and whether the Entity is a built-in Entity (fully pre-defined by the Protocol, automatically 
instantiated), a user-defined Entity (defined by the Protocol, but instantiated by the user only as needed by the 
application) or a vendor-specific Entity (defined by a vendor- specific extension to the Protocol, can therefore 
be ignored by another vendor’s implementation). 
When not pre-defined (see below), the entityKey field within the EntityId_t can be chosen arbitrarily by the 
middleware implementation as long as the resulting EntityId_t is unique within the Participant. 
The information on whether the object is a built-in entity, a vendor-specific entity, or a user-defined entity is 
encoded in the two most-significant bits of the entityKind. These two bits are set to: 
• ‘8 for user-defined entities. 
• ‘11’ for built-in entities. 
• ‘01’ for vendor-specific entities. 
The information on the kind of Entity is encoded in the last six bits of the entityKind field. Table 9.1 provides a 
complete list of the possible values of the entityKind supported in version 2.5 of the protocol. These are fixed

in this major version (2) of the protocol. New entity Kinds may be added in higher minor versions of the 
protocol in order to extend the model with new kinds of Entities.

Predefined EntityIds 
As mentioned above, the entity IDs for built-in entities are fully predefined by the RTPS Protocol. 
The PIM specifies that the EntityId_t of a Participant has the pre-defined value ENTITYID_PARTICIPANT 
(8.2.4.2). The corresponding PSM mapping of all pre-defined Entity IDs appears in Table 9.2 - EntityId_t 
values fully predefined by the RTPS Protocol. The meaning of these Entity IDs cannot change in this major 
version (2) of the protocol, but future minor versions may add additional reserved Entity IDs.

9.3.1.5 
Mapping of the GUID_t 
The PSM maps the GUID_t to the following structure: 
struct GUID_t { 
    GuidPrefix_t guidPrefix; 
    EntityId_t entityId; 
} ; 
Sub clause 8.2.4 states that all RTPS Entities with a DomainParticipant share the same guidPrefix. Furthermore 
8.2.4.2 states that implementors have freedom to choose the guidPrefix as long as each DomainParticipant 
within a DDS Domain has a unique guidPrefix. The PIM restricts this freedom. 
To comply with this specification, implementations of the RTPS protocol shall set the first two bytes of the 
guidPrefix to match their assigned vendorId (see 8.3.3.1.3). This ensures that the guidPrefix remains unique 
within a DDS Domain even if multiple implementations of the protocol are used. In other words,

## Page 153

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
147 
 
 
implementations of the RTPS protocol are free to use any technique they deem appropriate to generate unique 
values for the guidPrefix as long as they meet the following constraint: 
guidPrefix[0] = vendorId[0] guidPrefix[1] = vendorId[1] 
Future versions of the RTPS 2.x protocol shall also follow this rule for generating the guidPrefix. 
The value of these first two bytes is set as specified above with the sole purpose of enabling the generation of 
unique guidPrefix across implementations. This value should not be relied upon for other purposes. This ensures 
the change does not break interoperability with previous versions of the protocol. 
Use of the reserved vendorId is further described in 9.4.4. 
The reserved constant GUID_UNKNOWN defined by the PIM is mapped to: 
#define GUID_UNKNOWN{ GUIDPREFIX_UNKNOWN, ENTITYID_UNKNOWN } 
9.3.2 
Mapping of the Types that Appear Within Submessages or Built-in 
Topic Data 
9.3.2.1 
IDL Definitions 
The following IDL specifies the PSM mapping of the types that are introduced by the PIM that appear within 
messages sent by the protocol. There is no need to map the types that are used exclusively by the virtual 
machine, but do not appear in the messages. The subsections following the IDL provide additional information 
for the mapped types which require further clarification beyond the IDL type.

9.3.2.2 
Time_t 
The representation of the time is the one defined by the IETF Network Time Protocol (NTP) Standard (IETF 
RFC 1305). In this representation, time is expressed in seconds and fractions of seconds using the formula: 
time = seconds + (fraction / 2^(32)) 
9.3.2.3 
Duration_t 
The representation of the time is the one defined by the IETF Network Time Protocol (NTP) Standard (IETF 
RFC 1305). In this representation, time is expressed in seconds and fractions of seconds using the formula: 
time = seconds + (fraction / 2^(32)) 
Versions of the RTPS specification previous to version 2.4 did not specify the representation of Duration_t,  
therefore implementations should take into account the vendor and protocol version when interpreting these 
fields. 
9.3.2.4 
Locator_t 
If the Locator_t kind is LOCATOR_KIND_UPDv4, the address contains an IPv4 address. In this case, the leading 
12 octets of the address must be zero. The last 4 octets are used to store the IPv4 address. The mapping between 
the dot-notation “a.b.c.d” of an IPv4 address and its representation in the address field of a Locator_t is: 
address = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,a,b,c,d} 
If the Locator_t kind is LOCATOR_KIND_UPDv6, the address contains an IPv6 address. IPv6 addresses typically 
use a shorthand hexadecimal notation that maps one-to-one to the 16 octets in the address field. For example, 
the representation of the IPv6 address “FF00:4501:0:0:0:0:0:32” is: 
address = (0xff,0,0x45,0x01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x32} 
The range of Locator_t kinds has been divided into the following ranges: 
• 
0x00000003 - 0x01ffffff (inclusive) are reserved for vendor-specific Locator_t kinds and will not 
be used by any future versions of the RTPS protocol. 
• 
0x02000000 - 0x02ffffff (inclusive) are reserved for future use by the RTPS specification 
• 
0x03000000 and greater are reserved for Locator_t kinds that identify a transport developed by a 
third-party (i.e., are neither vendor nor protocol-specific) and will not be used by any future versions of 
the RTPS protocol. 
9.3.2.5 
GroupDigest_t 
This type is used to represent a group of Entities belonging to the same Participant. The representation uses the 
IDL structure EntityIdSet_t defined below: 
typedef octet OctetArray3[3];  
struct { 
    OctetArray3 entityKey;  
    octet entityKind; 
}; 
struct EntityIdSet_t { 
    sequence<EntityId_t> entityIds; 
}; 
In the construction of the entityIds sequence, the values are sorted by increasing values of the EntityId_t. To 
perform the ordering the EntityId_t, which is 4 octets, is re-interpreted as if it was the little-endian serialized 
representation of a 32-bit signed integer (the IDL4 int32 primitive type). 
The GroupDigest_t is computed from an EntityIdSet_t by first computing a 128 bit MD5 Digest (IETF RFC 
1321) applied to the CDR Big-Endian serialization of the structure EntityIdSet_t. The GroupDigest_t is the 
leading 4 octets of the MD5 Digest. 
The empty group is represented by a zero value of the GroupDigest_t. It is not computed as the hash of the 
serialized empty sequence.

9.3.2.6 
Checksum32_t, Checksum64_t, Checksum128_t 
These types are used to represent checksums of various lengths:  Checksum32_t represents a 32-bit checksum. 
Checksum64_t, and Checksum128_t represent a 64-bit, and 128-bit checksum, respectively. 
typedef octet  Checksum32_t[4]; 
typedef octet  Checksum64_t[8]; 
typedef octet  Checksum128_t[16]; 
9.3.2.7 
MessageLength_t 
This type is used to represent the length of an RTPS message. The representation uses a 32-bit unsigned integer. 
 
typedef unsigned long MessageLength_t;  
9.3.2.8 
UExtension4_t 
This type is used to represent an undefined 4-byte value. 
 
typedef octet UExtension4_t;  
9.3.2.9 
WExtension8_t 
This type is used to represent an undefined 8-byte value. 
 
typedef octet WExtension8_t;  
9.3.2.10 SequenceNumber_t 
This type is used to represent a 64-bit sequence number.  
The sequence number is represented using a structure that contains two 32-bit integers: high and low.  
 
struct SequenceNumber_t { 
    long high; 
    unsigned long low; 
};  
The 64-bit sequence number is obtained using the formula: 
sequence_number = low + high * 2^(32) 
9.3.2.11 ChangeCount_t 
This type is used to represent a 64-bit count.  
The change count is represented using a structure that contains two 32-bit integers: high and low.  
 
struct ChangeCount_t { 
    long high; 
    unsigned long low; 
};  
The 64-bit count is obtained using the formula: 
change_count = low + high * 2^(32) 
9.3.2.12 BuiltinEndpointSet_t 
This type is used to represent a list of builtin endpoints. 
The set of endpoints is represented using a bitmap. Each bit in the bitmap represents a specific builtin endpoint: 
 
bitmask BuiltinEndpointSet_t { 
    @position(0)  DISC_BUILTIN_ENDPOINT_PARTICIPANT_ANNOUNCER,

Mapping of the RTPS Messages 
9.4.1 
Overall Structure 
Sub clause 8.3.3 in the PIM defined the overall structure of a Message as composed of a leading Header 
followed by a variable number of Submessages. 
The PSM aligns each Submessage on a 32-bit boundary with respect to the start of the Message. 
Message: 
0...2...........7...............15.............23. ............. 31

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
A Message has a well-known length. This length is not sent explicitly by the RTPS protocol but is part of the 
underlying transport with which Messages are sent. In the case of UDP/IP, the length of the Message is the 
length of the UDP payload. 
9.4.2 
Mapping of the PIM SubmessageElements 
Each RTPS Submessage is built from a set of predefined atomic building blocks called “submessage elements,” 
as defined in 8.3.5. This sub clause describes the PSM mapping for each of the SubmessageElements 
defined by the PIM.

9.4.2.6 
SequenceNumberSet 
The PSM maps the SequenceNumberSet SubmessageElement defined in 8.3.5.5 to the following structure: 
typedef sequence<long, 8> LongSeq8;  
struct SequenceNumberSet { 
SequenceNumber_t bitmapBase; 
LongSeq8 bitmap; 
}; 
The above structure offers a compact representation encoding a set of up to 256 sequence numbers. The 
representation of the SequenceNumberSet includes the first sequence number in the set (bitmapBase) and a 
bitmap of up to 256 bits. The number of bits in the bitmap is denoted by numBits. The value of each bit in the 
bitmap indicates whether the SequenceNumber obtained by adding the offset of the bit to the bitmapBase is 
included (bit=1) or excluded (bit=0) from the SequenceNumberSet. 
More precisely a SequenceNumber ‘seqNum’ belongs to the SequenceNumberSet ‘seqNumSet,’ if and only if 
the following two conditions apply: 
seqNumSet.bitmapBase <= seqNum < seqNumSet.bitmapBase  
                                      + seqNumSet.numBits(bitmap[deltaN/ 32] 
    &  (1 << (31 - deltaN%32))) == (1 << (31 - deltaN%32)) 
where 
deltaN = seqNum - seqNumSet.bitmapBase 
A valid SequenceNumberSet must satisfy the following conditions: 
• bitmapBase >= 1 
• 0 <= numBits <= 256 
• there are M=(numBits+31)/32 longs containing the pertinent bits This document uses the following 
notation for a specific bitmap: 
bitmapBase/numBits:bitmap 
In the bitmap, the bit corresponding to sequence number bitmapBase is on the left. The ending "0" bits can be 
represented as one "0."

## Page 161

DDSI-RTPS v2.5

For example, in bitmap “1234/12:00110”, bitmapBase=1234 and numBits=12. The bits apply as follows to the 
sequence numbers:

The numBits field encodes both the number of significant bits and the number of bitmap elements. Due to this 
optimization, this SubmessageElement does not follow CDR encoding. 
9.4.2.7 
FragmentNumber 
The PSM mapping for the FragmentNumber SubmessageElement defined in 8.3.5.6 is given by the 
following IDL definition: 
typedef FragmentNumber_t FragmentNumber;

typedef sequence<long, 8> LongSeq8; struct 
FragmentNumberSet {

The above structure offers a compact representation encoding a set of up to 256 fragment numbers. The 
representation of the FragmentNumberSet includes the first fragment number in the set (bitmapBase) and a 
bitmap of up to 256 bits. The interpretation matches that of a SequenceNumberSet. 
The wire representation of the FragmentNumberSet SubmessageElement is:

9.4.2.11 ParameterList 
A ParameterList contains a list of Parameters, each identified by a parameterId, optionally terminated 
with a sentinel.  
 Serialized Wire Representation 
Each Parameter within the ParameterList starts aligned on a 4-byte boundary with respect to the start 
of the ParameterList. 
The IDL representation for each Parameter is: 
typedef short ParameterId_t; 
struct Parameter { 
ParameterId_t parameterId;  
short length; 
octet value[length]; // Pseudo-IDL: array of non-const length 
}; 
The parameterId identifies the type of parameter. 
The length encodes the number of octets following the length to reach the ID of the next parameter (or the ID of 
the sentinel). Because every parameterId starts on a 4-byte boundary, the length is always a multiple of four. 
The value contains the CDR representation of the Parameter type that corresponds to the specified parameterId.  
 
For alignment purposes, the CDR stream is logically reset for each parameter value (i.e., no initial padding is 
required) after the parameterId and length are serialized. 
The ParameterList may contain multiple Parameters with the same value for the parameterId. This is used 
to provide a collection of values for that kind of Parameter. 
The use of ParameterList representation makes it possible to extend the protocol and introduce new 
parameters and still be able to preserve interoperability with earlier versions of the protocol. 
The wire representation for the ParameterList is:

PID_SENTINEL 
| 
ignored 
| 
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ 
There are two predefined values of the parameterId: 
#define PID_PAD (0) 
#define PID_SENTINEL (1) 
The PID_SENTINEL is used to terminate the parameter list and its length is ignored. The PID_PAD is used to 
enforce alignment of the parameter that follows and its length can be anything (as long as it is a multiple of 4). 
The presence of the PID_SENTINEL is required in situations where it is not possible to determine the end of 
the ParameterList by some other mechanism.  
• 
The presence of the PID_SENTINEL is not required in the ParameterList that appears in the 
HeaderExtension. See 9.4.5.2. 
• 
The presence of the PID_SENTINEL is required in all other cases. 
The complete set of possible values for the parameterId in version 2.5 of the protocol appears in 9.6.4. 
 ParameterId space 
As described in 9.4.2.11.1, the ParameterId space is 16 bits wide. In order to accommodate vendor specific 
options and future extensions to the protocol, the ParameterId space is partitioned into multiple subspaces. The 
ParameterId subspaces are listed in Table 9.6.

## Page 165

Table 9.6 - ParameterId subspaces

1 
Vendor-specific ParameterId. 
Will not be recognized by other vendors’ implementations. 
ParameterId & 4000 
(Ignore or Must 
Understand) 
0 
If the ParameterId is not recognized, skip and ignore the parameter. 
1 
If the ParameterId is not recognized, treat it as an error. 
If the ParameterId appears in the HeaderExtension, ignore the entire 
RTPS message. 
If the ParameterId appears in any other Submessage, ignore the 
Submessage and continue with the next Submessage in the RTPS 
message, if any. 
The first subspace division enables vendor-specific ParameterIds. Future minor versions of the RTPS protocol 
can add new parameters up to a maximum ParameterId of 0x7fff.  
The range 0x8000 to 0xffff is reserved for vendor-specific options and will not be used by any future versions 
of the protocol.  
Other specifications may reserve portions of the protocol-specific range of ParameterIds. Table 9.7 lists the 
ParameterIds reserved for use by other specifications and future revisions thereof. Other specifications may 
reserve portions of the protocol-specific range of ParameterIds. Table 9.7 lists the ParameterIds reserved for use 
by other specifications and future revisions thereof.

• 
0x0072-0x0075 
• 
0x3f01-0x3fff 
• 
0x7f01-0x7fff 
For backwards compatibility, both subspaces are subdivided again. If a ParameterId is expected, but not present, 
the protocol will assume the default value. Similarly, if a ParameterId is present but not recognized, the protocol 
will either skip and ignore the parameter or treat the parameter as an incompatible QoS. The actual behavior 
depends on the ParameterId value, see Table 9.6. 
9.4.2.12 SerializedPayload 
A SerializedPayload SubmessageElement contains the serialized representation of either value of an 
application- defined data-object or the value of the key that uniquely identifies the data-object. 
The specification of the process used to encode the application-level data-type into a serialized byte-stream is 
not strictly part of the RTPS protocol. For the purpose of interoperability, all implementations must however use 
a consistent representation (See, 10 Serialized Payload Representation). 
The wire representation for the SerializedPayload is:

9.4.2.15 Checksum 
The Checksum submessage element only appears as part of the HeaderExtension submessage. Depending 
on the value of the ChecksumFlags that appear in the HeaderExtension flags, see 9.4.5.2.1. 
The PSM maps the Checksum SubmessageElement defined in 8.3.5.12 to one of three structures: 
Checksum32_t,  Checksum64_t, or Checksum128_t.  
This format and interpretation of the Checksum is described in Table 9.8.

Checksum32_t 
The messageChecksum is a 32-bit checksum. It shall hold the big-
endian representation of the CRC-32C (Castagnoli) checksum of the 
RTPS message. 
The result of the CRC calculation is a 32-bit integer. It shall be 
serialized into the 4-bytes of the Checksum32_t type using CDR big 
endian encoding. 
1, 0 
Checksum64_t 
The messageChecksum is a 64-bit checksum. It shall hold the big-
endian representation of the CRC-64/XZ checksum of the RTPS 
message.

endian encoding. 
1,1 
Checksum128_t 
The messageChecksum is a 128-bit checksum. It shall hold the MD5

Following the CDR encoding, the wire representation of the Checksum SubmessageElement is one of the 
following:

+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ 
Note that as specified 8.3.7.2, the checksum shall be computed over the content of the RTPS Message, which 
includes the RTPS Header and HeaderExtension submessage. Moreover, for the purpose of computing 
the checksum, all the bytes of the messageChecksum field in the RTPS HeaderExtension shall be set to 
zero. 
 CRC Computation Parameters 
The full specification of the CRC checksum computation requires specifying the following parameters: 
• 
CRC result width. The number of bits used to encode the resulting checksum. 
• 
Polynomial. The polynomial used for the CRC computation. It may be represented explicitly, or using 
more compact representations, such as, msbit-first (also known as the ‘normal’ representation) and 
lsbit-first (also known as ‘reversed’ representation).  
• 
Input data reflected. Boolean value that defines whether the bits of each input byte are reflected 
before being processed. 
• 
Result data reflected. Boolean value that defines whether the bits of the result are reflected. The result 
is reflected over a number of bits that correspond to the CRC result width. That is, over 32-bit for a 
CRC-32 and 64 bits for a CRC-64. 
• 
Initial value. Integer value that defines the start condition for the CRC algorithm. The integer has the 
same bit size as the CRC result width. That is, 32-bits for a CRC-32 and 64 bits for a CRC-64.

## Page 168

DDSI-RTPS v2.5

• 
Final XOR value. This Value is XORed at the end of the computation, resulting in the value of the 
checksum. 
 Parameters used by Checksum32_t  
The parameters and the algorithm used shall correspond to the CRC-32C algorithm defined in IETF RFC 4960 
Appendix B[6]. These parameters are shown in the table below:

Additional SubmessageElements 
In addition to the SubmessageElements introduced by the PIM, the UDP PSM introduces the following 
additional SubmessageElements. 
9.4.3.1 
LocatorUDPv4 
The LocatorUDPv4 SubmessageElement is identical to a LocatorList SubmessageElement containing 
a single locator of kind LOCATOR_KIND_UDPv4. LocatorUDPv4 is introduced to provide a more compact 
representation when using UDP on IPv4.

Mapping of the RTPS Header 
Sub clause 8.3.8 in the PIM specifies that all messages should include a leading RTPS Header. The PSM 
mapping of the RTPS Header is shown below:

The structure of the Header cannot change in this major version (2) of the protocol. 
The RTPS Header includes a vendorId field, see 8.3.5.2. To be compliant with the DDS Interoperability 
Specification a vendor must have a reserved Vendor ID and use it. See 8.3.3.1.3 for details on where to find the 
current list of vendor IDs and how to request a new one to be assigned.

9.4.5 
Mapping of the RTPS Submessages 
9.4.5.1 
Submessage Header 
Sub clause 8.3.3.3 in the PIM defined the structure of all Submessages as composed of a leading 
SubmessageHeader followed by a variable number of SubmessageElements. 
The PSM maps the SubmessageHeader into the following structure: 
struct SubmessageHeader {  
    octet submessageId; octet flags; 
    unsigned short submessageLength; /* octetsToNextHeader */ 
}; 
With the byte stream representation defined in 9.2.3, the submessageLength is defined as the number of octets 
from the start of the contents of the Submessage to the start of the next Submessage header. Given this 
definition, the remainder of the UDP PSM will refer to submessageLength as octetsToNextHeader. See also 
9.4.5.1.3. 
Following the CDR encoding, the wire representation of the SubmessageHeader is shown below: 
SubmessageHeader: 
0...2...........8...............16.............24. ............. 32 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

| 
| 
| 
following are the 
| 
~ 
contents of Submessage 
~ 
| 
| 
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ 
This general structure cannot change in this major version (2) of the protocol. The following sub clauses discuss 
each member of the SubmessageHeader in more detail. 
 
SubmessageId 
This octet identifies the kind of Submessage. Submessages with IDs 0x00 to 0x7f (inclusive) are protocol-
specific. They are defined as part of the RTPS protocol. Version 2.5 defines the following Submessages: 
enum SubmessageKind {  
    @value(0x00)  RTPS_HE,          /* HeaderExtension */ 
    @value(0x01)  PAD,              /* Pad */ 
    @value(0x06)  ACKNACK 
 
/* AckNack */ 
    @value(0x07)  HEARTBEAT  
/* Heartbeat */ 
    @value(8x08)  GAP  
 
/* Gap */ 
    @value(0x09)  INFO_TS 
 
/* InfoTimestamp */ 
    @value(0x0c)  INFO_SRC 
 
/* InfoSource */ 
    @value(0x0d)  INFO_REPLY_IP4 
/* InfoReplyIp4 */ 
    @value(0x0e)  INFO_DST 
 
/* InfoDestination */ 
    @value(0x0f)  INFO_REPLY  
/* InfoReply */ 
    @value(0x12)  NACK_FRAG  
/* NackFrag */ 
    @value(0x13)  HEARTBEAT_FRAG 
/* HeartbeatFrag */ 
    @value(0x15)  DATA  
 
/* Data */ 
    @value(0x16)  DATA_FRAG  
/* DataFrag */ 
}; 
The meaning of the Submessage IDs cannot be modified in this major version (2). Additional Submessages can 
be added in higher minor versions. Submessages with ID's 0x80 to 0xff (inclusive) are vendor-specific; they 
will not be defined by future versions of the protocol. Their interpretation is dependent on the vendorId that is 
current when the Submessage is encountered.

9.4.5.1.1.1 
Submessage Ranges Reserved by other Specifications 
Other specifications may reserve portions of the protocol-specific range of Submessage IDs. Table 9.14 lists the 
Submessage IDs reserved for use by other specifications and future revisions thereof. 
Table 9.14 - Submessage IDs Reserved by other Specifications (all ranges are inclusive) 
Specification 
Reserved Submessage IDs 
DDS-Security 1.1 
0x30-0x3f 
 
flags 
Sub clause 8.3.3.3 in the PIM defines the EndiannessFlag as a flag present in all Submessages that indicates the 
endianness used to encode the Submessage. The PSM maps the EndiannessFlag flag into the least-significant 
bit (LSB) of the flags. This bit is therefore always present in all Submessages and represents the endianness 
used to encode the information in the Submessage. The EndiannessFlag is represented with the literal ‘E’. E=0 
means big-endian, E=1 means little-endian. 
The value of the EndiannessFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
E = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x01 
Other bits in the flags have interpretations that depend on the type of Submessage. 
In the following descriptions of the Submessages, the character 'X' is used to indicate a flag that is unused in 
version 2.5 of the protocol. Implementations of RTPS version 2.5 should set these to zero when sending and 
ignore these when receiving. Higher minor versions of the protocol can use these flags. 
 
octetsToNextHeader 
The representation of this field is a CDR unsigned short (ushort). 
In case octetsToNextHeader > 0, it is the number of octets from the first octet of the contents of the Submessage 
until the first octet of the header of the next Submessage (in case the Submessage is not the last Submessage in 
the Message) OR it is the number of octets remaining in the Message (in case the Submessage is the last 
Submessage in the Message). An interpreter of the Message can distinguish these two cases as it knows the 
total length of the Message. 
In case octetsToNextHeader==0 and the kind of Submessage is NOT PAD or INFO_TS, the Submessage is the 
last Submessage in the Message and extends up to the end of the Message. This makes it possible to send 
Submessages larger than 64k (the size that can be stored in the octetsToNextHeader field), provided they are the 
last Submessage in the Message. 
In case the octetsToNextHeader==0 and the kind of Submessage is PAD or INFO_TS, the next Submessage 
header starts immediately after the current Submessage header OR the PAD or INFO_TS is the last 
Submessage in the Message. 
9.4.5.2 
HeaderExtension Submessage 
Sub clause 8.3.7 in the PIM defines the logical contents of HeaderExtension Submessage. The PSM maps 
the HeaderExtension Submessage to the following wire representation:

Flags in the Submessage Header 
In addition to the EndiannessFlag, The HeaderExtension Submessage introduces the LengthFlag, 
TimestampFlag, UExtension4Flag, WExtension8Flag, ChecksumFlags and ParametersFlag. See 8.3.7.2.  
The LengthFlag is represented with the literal ‘L’. L=1 means the HeaderExtension includes the 
messageLength. 
The value of the LengthFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
L = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x02 
The TimestampFlag is represented with the literal ‘T’. T=1 means the HeaderExtension includes the 
Timestamp submessage element.  
The value of the UExtension4Flag can be obtained from the expression: 
T = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x04 
The UExtension4Flag is represented with the literal ‘U’. U=1 means the HeaderExtension includes the 
uExtension4 submessage element.  
The value of the UExtension4Flag can be obtained from the expression: 
U = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x08 
The WExtension8Flag is represented with the literal ‘W’. W=1 means the HeaderExtension includes the 
wExtension8 submessage element.  
The value of the WExtension4Flag can be obtained from the expression: 
W = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x10 
The ChecksumFlags are represented with the literal ‘C’. There are three two flags: C1 and C2. When the two 
‘C’ flags are set to zero, the HeaderExtension does not include the messageChecksum, any other value of 
the flags indicates the messageChecksum is included. 
The value of the C1 and C2 flags can be obtained from the expressions: 
C1 = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x40 
C2 = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x20

The ParamatersFlag is represented with the literal ‘P’. P=1 means the HeaderExtension includes the 
parameters. 
The value of the ParamatersFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
P = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x80 
9.4.5.3 
AckNack Submessage 
Sub clause 8.3.8.1 in the PIM defines the logical contents of the AckNack Submessage. The PSM maps the

Flags in the Submessage Header 
In addition to the EndiannessFlag, The AckNack Submessage introduces the FinalFlag (“Content” on page 
46). The PSM maps the FinalFlag flag into the 2nd least-significant bit (LSB) of the flags. 
The FinalFlag is represented with the literal ‘F’. F=1 means the reader does not require a Heartbeat from the 
writer. F=0 means the writer must respond to the AckNack message with a Heartbeat message. 
The value of the FinalFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
F = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x02 
9.4.5.4 
Data Submessage

Flags in the Submessage Header 
In addition to the EndiannessFlag, The Data Submessage introduces the InlineQosFlag, DataFlag, and Key 
(see 8.3.8.3.2). The PSM maps these flags as follows:

## Page 175

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
169 
 
 
The InlineQosFlag is represented with the literal ‘Q.’ Q=1 means that the Data Submessage contains the 
inlineQos SubmessageElement. 
The value of the InlineQosFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
Q = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x02 
The DataFlag is represented with the literal ‘D.’ The value of the DataFlag can be obtained from the 
expression. 
D = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x04 
The KeyFlag is represented with the literal ‘K.’ The value of the KeyFlag can be obtained from the expression. 
K = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x08 
The DataFlag is interpreted in combination with the KeyFlag as follows: 
• D=0 and K=0 means that there is no serializedPayload SubmessageElement. 
• D=1 and K=0 means that the serializedPayload SubmessageElement contains the serialized 
Data. 
• D=0 and K=1 means that the serializedPayload SubmessageElement contains the serialized Key. 
• D=1 and K=1 is an invalid combination in this version of the protocol. 
The NonStandardPayloadFlag is represented with the literal ‘N.’ The value of the NonStandardPayloadFlag 
can be obtained from the expression. 
N = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x10 
 
extraFlags 
The extraFlags field provides space for an additional 16 bits of flags beyond the 8 bits provided as in the 
submessage header. These additional bits will support evolution of the protocol without compromising 
backwards compatibility. 
This version of the protocol should set all the bits in the extraFlags to zero. 
 
octetsToInlineQos 
The representation of this field is a CDR unsigned short (ushort). 
The octetsToInlineQos field contains the number of octets starting from the first octet immediately following 
this field until the first octet of the inlineQos SubmessageElement. If the inlineQos SubmessageElement is not 
present (i.e., the InlineQosFlag is not set), then octetsToInlineQos contains the offset to the next field after 
the inlineQos. 
Implementations of the protocol that are processing a received submessage should always use the 
octetsToInlineQos to skip any submessage header elements it does not expect or understand and continue to 
process the inlineQos SubmessageElement (or the first submessage element that follows inlineQos if the 
inlineQos is not present). This rule is necessary so that the receiver will be able to interoperate with senders that 
use future versions of the protocol which may include additional submessage headers before the inlineQos. 
9.4.5.5 
DataFrag Submessage 
Sub clause 8.3.8.3 in the PIM defines the logical contents of the DataFrag Submessage. The PSM maps the 
DataFrag 
Submessage into the following wire representation:

Flags in the Submessage Header 
In addition to the EndiannessFlag, The DataFrag Submessage introduces the KeyFlag and InlineQosFlag 
(see 8.3.8.1.2). The PSM maps these flags as follows: 
The InlineQosFlag is represented with the literal ‘Q’. Q=1 means that the DataFrag Submessage contains 
the inlineQos SubmessageElement. 
The value of the InlineQosFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
Q = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x02 
The KeyFlag is represented with the literal ‘K.’ 
The value of the KeyFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
K = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x04 
K=0 means that the serializedPayload SubmessageElement contains the serialized Data. K=1 means that the 
serializedPayload SubmessageElement contains the serialized Key. 
The NonStandardPayloadFlag is represented with the literal ‘N.’ The value of the NonStandardPayloadFlag 
can be obtained from the expression. 
N = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x08 
9.4.5.6 
Gap Submessage 
Sub clause 8.3.8.4 in the PIM defines the logical contents of the Gap Submessage. The PSM maps the Gap

Flags in the Submessage Header 
In addition to the EndiannessFlag, the Gap Submessage introduces the GroupInfoFlag (8.3.8.4.2) and the 
FilteredCountFlag. 
The PSM maps the GroupInfoFlag flag into the 2nd least-significant bit (LSB) of the flags. 
The GroupInfoFlag is represented with the literal ‘G. G=1 means the Gap also includes a gapStartGSN and a 
gapEndGSN. 
The value of the GroupInfoFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
G = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x02 
The PSM maps the FilteredCountFlag flag into the 3rd least-significant bit (LSB) of the flags. 
The FilteredCountFlag is represented with the literal ‘F’. F=1 means the Gap also includes a filteredCount.

Flags in the Submessage Header 
In addition to the EndiannessFlag, the HeartBeat Submessage introduces the FinalFlag, the LivelinessFlag, 
and the GroupInfoFlag (8.3.8.6.2). The PSM maps the FinalFlag flag into the 2nd least-significant bit (LSB) of 
the flags, the LivelinessFlag into the 3rd least-significant bit (LSB) of the flags, and the GroupInfoFlag into the 
4th least-significant bit (LSB) of the flags. 
The FinalFlag is represented with the literal ‘F’. F=1 means the Writer does not require a response from the 
Reader. F=0 means the Reader must respond to the HeartBeat message. 
The value of the FinalFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
F = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x02 
The LivelinessFlag is represented with the literal ‘L’. L=1 means the DDS DataReader associated with the 
RTPS Reader should refresh the ‘manual’ liveliness of the DDS DataWriter associated with the RTPS Writer of 
the message. The value of the LivelinessFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
L = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x04 
The GroupInfoFlag is represented with the literal ‘G’. G=1 means the HeartBeat includes the currentGSN, 
firstGSN, and lastGSN. The value of the LivelinessFlag can be obtained from the expression: 
G = SubmessageHeader.flags & 0x08

9.4.5.15 InfoReplyIp4 Submessage (PSM specific) 
The InfoReplyIp4 Submessage is an additional Submessage introduced by the UDP PSM. 
Its use and interpretation are identical to those of an InfoReply Submessage containing a single unicast and 
possibly a single multicast locator, both of kind LOCATOR_KIND_UDPv4. It is provided for efficiency reasons and 
can be used instead of the InfoReply Submessage to provide a more compact representation.

maps the MulticastFlag flag into the 2nd least-significant bit (LSB) of the flags. 
The MulticastFlag is represented with the literal ‘M’. M=1 means the InfoReplyIp4 also includes a 
multicastLocator.

9.5 
Mapping to UDP/IP Transport Messages 
When RTPS is used over UDP/IP, a Message is the contents (payload) of exactly one UDP/IP Datagram. 
9.6 
Mapping of the RTPS Protocol 
9.6.1 
ParameterId definitions in the HeaderExtension 
This version of the protocol does not specify any ParameterId that may appear in the HeaderExtension.  
The ParameterId space for parameters in the HeaderExtension shall be as specified in 9.4.2.11.2 Compliant 
implementations encountering an unrecognized ParameterId within the HeaderExtension shall either skip 
and the parameter or reject the entire RTPS Message, as specified in Table 9.6. 
9.6.2 
Default Locators 
9.6.2.1 
Discovery traffic 
Discovery traffic is the traffic generated by the Participant and Endpoint Discovery Protocols. For the Simple 
Discovery Protocols (SPDP and SEDP), discovery traffic is the traffic exchanged between the built-in 
Endpoints. 
The SPDP built-in Endpoints are configured using well-known ports (see 8.5.3.4). The UDP PSM maps these 
well-known ports to the port number expressions listed in Table 9.15. 
Table 9.15 - Ports used by built-in Endpoints 
Discovery 
traffic type 
SPDP well-known port 
Default port number 
expression 
Multicast 
SPDP_WELL_KNOWN_MULTICAST_PORT 
PB + DG * domainId + d0 
Unicast 
SPDP_WELL_KNOWN_UNICAST_PORT 
PB + DG * domainId + d1 + PG * 
participantId 
where 
domainId = DDS Domain identifier  
participantId = Participant identifier 
PB, DG, d0, d1 = tunable parameters (defined below) 
The domainId and participantId identifiers are used to avoid port conflicts among Participants on the same 
node. Each Participant on the same node and in the same domain must use a unique participantId. In the case 
of multicast, all Participants in the same domain share the same port number, so the participantId identifier is 
not used in the port number expression. 
To simplify the configuration of the SPDP, participantId values ideally start at 0 and are incremented for each 
additional Participant on the same node and in the same domain. That way, for a given domain, Participants 
can announce their presence to up to N remote Participants on a given node, by announcing to port numbers on 
that node corresponding to participantId 0 through N-1. 
The default ports used by the SEDP built-in Endpoints match those used by the SPDP. If a node chooses not to 
use the default ports for the SEDP, it can include the new port numbers as part of the information exchanged 
during the SPDP.

9.6.2.2 
User traffic 
User traffic is the traffic exchanged between user-defined Endpoints (i.e., non-built-in Endpoints). As such, it 
pertains to all the traffic that is not related to discovery. By default, user-defined Endpoints use the port number 
expressions listed in Table 9.16. 
Table 9.16 - Ports used by user-defined Endpoints 
User traffic type 
Default port number expression 
Multicast 
PB + DG * domainId + d2 
Unicast 
PB + DG * domainId + d3 + PG * participantId 
User-defined Endpoints may choose to not use the default ports. In that case, remote Endpoints obtain the port 
number as part of the information exchanged during the Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol. 
9.6.2.3 
Default Port Numbers 
The port number expressions use the following parameters: 
DG = DomainId Gain 
PG = ParticipantId Gain  
PB = Port Base number 
d0, d1, d2, d3 = additional offsets 
Implementations must expose these parameters so they can be customized by the user. 
In order to enable out-of-the-box interoperability, the following default values must be used: 
PB = 7400 
DG = 250 
PG = 2 
d0 = 0 
d1 = 10 
d2 = 1 
d3 = 11 
Given UDP port numbers are limited to 64K, the above defaults enable the use of about 230 domains with up to 
120 Participants per node per domain. 
9.6.2.4 
Default Settings for the Simple Participant Discovery Protocol 
When using the SPDP, each Participant sends announcements to a pre-configured list of locators. What ports to 
use when configuring these locators is discussed above. This sub clause describes any remaining settings that 
are required to enable plug-and-play interoperability. 
 
Default multicast address 
In order to enable plug-and-play interoperability, the default pre-configured list of locators must include the 
following multicast locator (assuming UDPv4): 
DefaultMulticastLocator = {LOCATOR_KIND_UDPv4, “239.255.0.1”, PB + DG * 
domainId + d0} 
All Participants must announce and listen on this multicast address. 
SPDPbuiltinParticipantWriter.readerLocators CONTAINS DefaultMulticastLocator 
SPDPbuiltinParticipantReader.multicastLocatorList CONTAINS 
DefaultMulticastLocator 
 
Default announcement rate 
The default rate by which SPDP periodic announcements are sent equals 30 seconds. 
SPDPbuiltinParticipantWriter.resendPeriod = {30, 0};

9.6.3 
Data representation for the built-in Endpoints 
9.6.3.1 
Data Representation for the ParticipantMessageData Built-in Endpoints 
The Behavior module within the PIM (8.4) defines the DataType ParticipantMessageData. This type is the 
logical content of the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and BuiltinParticipantMessageReader built-in 
Endpoints. 
The PSM maps the ParticipantMessageData type into the following IDL: 
typedef octet OctetArray4[4];  
typedef sequence<octet> OctetSeq;  
struct ParticipantMessageData { 
GuidPrefix_t 
participantGuidPrefix;  
OctetArray4 
kind; 
OctetSeq 
data; 
}; 
The following values for the kind field are reserved by RTPS: 
#define PARTICIPANT_MESSAGE_DATA_KIND_UNKNOWN {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00} 
#define PARTICIPANT_MESSAGE_DATA_KIND_AUTOMATIC_LIVELINESS_UPDATE {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01} 
#define PARTICIPANT_MESSAGE_DATA_KIND_MANUAL_LIVELINESS_UPDATE {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02} 
RTPS also reserves for future use all values of the kind field where the most significant bit is not set. Therefore: 
kind.value[0] & 0x80 == 0 // reserved by RTPS  
kind.value[0] & 0x80 == 1 // vendor specific kind 
Implementations can decide the upper length of the data field but must be able to support at least 128 bytes. 
Following the CDR encoding, the wire representation of the ParticipantMessageData structure is: 
0...2...........8...............16..............24..............32

9.6.3.2 
Simple Discovery Protocol built-in Endpoints 
The Discovery Module within the PIM (8.5) defines the DataTypes SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData, 
DiscoveredWriterData, DiscoveredReaderData, and DiscoveredTopicData. These types define the logical 
contents of the data sent between the RTPS built-in Endpoints. 
The PSM maps these types into the following IDL: 
struct SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData {  
    DDS::ParticipantBuiltinTopicData ddsParticipantData;  
    ParticipantProxy participantProxy; 
    Duration_t leaseDuration; 
}; 
 
struct DiscoveredWriterData {  
    DDS::PublicationBuiltinTopicData ddsPublicationData;

## Page 185

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
179 
 
 
    WriterProxy mWriterProxy; 
}; 
 
struct DiscoveredReaderData {  
    DDS::SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData ddsSubscriptionData;  
    ReaderProxy mReaderProxy; 
ContentFilterProperty_t contentFilter; 
}; 
 
struct DiscoveredTopicData {  
    DDS::TopicBuiltinTopicData ddsTopicData; 
}; 
where each DDS built-in topic data type is defined by the DDS specification. 
The discovery data is sent using standard Data Submessages. In order to allow for QoS extensibility while 
preserving interoperability between versions of the protocol, the wire-representation of the SerializedData 
within the Data Submessage uses the format of a ParameterList SubmessageElement. That is, the 
SerializedData contains each QoS and other information within a separate parameter identified by a 
ParameterId. Within each parameter, the parameter value is represented using CDR. 
For example, in order to add a vendor-specific Endpoint Discovery Protocol (EDP) in the 
SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData, a vendor could define a vendor-specific parameterId and use it to add a new 
parameter to the ParameterList contained in SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData. The presence of this 
parameterId would denote support for the corresponding EDP. As this is a vendor-specific parameterId, other 
vendors’ implementations would simply ignore the parameter and the information it contains. The parameter 
itself would contain any additional data required by the vendor-specific EDP represented using CDR. 
For optimization, implementations of the protocol shall not include a parameter in the Data submessage if it 
contains information that is redundant with other parameters already present in that same Data submessage. As a 
result of this optimization an implementation shall omit the serialization of the parameters listed in    Table 
9.17. 
The key-only messages for the built-in topics are defined as follows. In the case of a DATA submessage 
containing the SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData with KeyFlag=1, the only parameterId present within the 
ParameterList shall be the PID_PARTICIPANT_GUID. In the case of a DATA submessage containing 
one of SEDPdiscoveredPublicationData, SEDPdiscoveredSubscriptionData, or SEDPdiscoveredTopicData 
with KeyFlag=1, the only parameterId present within the ParameterList shall be the 
PID_ENDPOINT_GUID. 
   Table 9.17 - Omitted Builtin Endpoint Parameters

Parameter where the 
information on the omitted

ParticipantProxy::guidPrefix 
ParticipantBuiltinTopicData::key 
DiscoveredReaderData 
ReaderProxy::remoteReaderGuid 
SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData::key 
DiscoveredWriterData 
WriterProxy::remoteWriterGuid 
PublicationBuiltinTopicData::key 
For example, an implementation of the protocol sending DATA message containing the 
SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData, SEDPdiscoveredPublicationData, or SEDPdiscoveredSubscriptionData shall 
omit the parameter that contains the guidPrefix. The implementation of the protocol in the receiver side shall 
derive this value from the “key” parameter which is one of the following: “ParticipantBuiltinTopicData::key”, 
“SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData::key”, or “PublicationBuiltinTopicData::key”.

ParameterId Definitions used to Represent In-line QoS 
The Messages module within the PIM (8.3) provides the means for the Data (8.3.8.2) and DataFrag 
(8.3.8.3) Submessages to include QoS policies in-line with the Submessage. The QoS policies are contained 
using a ParameterList. 
Sub clause 8.7.2.1 defines the complete set of parameters that can appear within the inlineQos 
SubmessageElement. The corresponding set of parameterIds is listed in Table 9.20. Unrecognized parameterIDs 
shall be treated as specified in Table 9.6.

The policies that can appear in-line include a subset of the DataWriter QoS policies (ParameterId defined in 
9.6.3) and some additional QoS (for which a new ParameterId is defined). 
The following sub clauses describe these additional QoS in more detail. 
9.6.4.1 
Content filter info (PID_CONTENT_FILTER_INFO) 
Following the CDR encoding, the wire representation of the ContentFilterInfo_t (see 9.3.2) in-line QoS is: 
 
4 RTPS protocol versions prior to 2.4 defined this as a sequence<GUID_t>. However, some vendors were sending a GUID_t 
instead. Therefore, when interacting with protocol versions earlier than 2.4 this parameter should be ignored unless the 
receiver knows the format used by the vendor that sent the InlineQos.

The filterResult member is encoded as a bitmap. Bit 0 (MSB) corresponds to the first filter signature, bit 1 to the 
second filter signature, and so on. The content filter info in-line QoS is invalid unless 
numBitmaps == ([numSignatures/32] + (numSignatures%32 ? 1 : 0)) 
The bitmap is interpreted as follows: 
Table 9.21 - Interpretation of filterResult member in content filter info in-line QoS 
bit value 
Interpretation 
0 
Sample was filtered by the corresponding filter and did not pass. 
1 
Sample was filtered by the corresponding filter and passed. 
A filter’s signature is calculated as the 128-bit MD5 checksum of all strings in the filter's 
ContentFilterProperty_t. More precisely, all strings are combined into the following character array: 
[ contentFilteredTopicName relatedTopicName filterClassName filterExpression 
expressionParameters[0] expressionParameters[1] ... 
expressionParameters[numParams - 1] ] 
where each individual string includes its NULL termination character. The filter signature is calculated by 
taking the MD5 checksum of the above character sequence. 
9.6.4.2 
Coherent set (PID_COHERENT_SET) 
The coherent set in-line QoS parameter uses the CDR encoding for SequenceNumber_t. 
As defined in 8.7.5, all Data and DataFrag Submessages that belong to the same coherent set must contain 
the coherent set in-line QoS parameter with value equal to the sequence number of the first sample in the set.

For example, assume a coherent set contains sample updates with sequence numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 from a given 
Writer. Samples in this coherent set are identified by including the coherent set in-line QoS parameter with 
value 3. Some example Data submessages that the Writer can use to denote the end of this coherent set are 
listed in Table 9.22.

Group Coherent Set (PID_GROUP_COHERENT_SET) 
The group coherent set in-line QoS parameter uses the CDR encoding for SequenceNumber_t. 
As defined in 8.7.6, all Data submessages and the first DataFrag submessage belonging to a sample must 
contain the group coherent set in-line QoS parameter with value equal to the group sequence number of the first 
sample in the set. 
For example, assume a group coherent set contains samples with group sequence numbers 11, 12, and 13 from 
two Writers. Samples in the coherent set are identified by including coherent set in-line QoS parameters and 
group coherent set in-line QoS parameters, among others. Example Data Submessages are listed in Table 9.23.

Group Sequence Number (PID_GROUP_SEQ_NUM) 
The group sequence number in-line QoS parameter uses the CDR encoding for SequenceNumber_t. 
As defined in 8.7.5, all Data submessages and the first DataFrag submessage sent by DataWriters belonging 
to a Publisher with Presentation access scope GROUP must contain the group sequence number in-line QoS 
parameter with value equal to the group sequence number. 
9.6.4.5 
Publisher Writer Info (PID_WRITER_GROUP_INFO) 
The publisher writer info in-line QoS parameter uses the CDR encoding for WriterGroupInfo_t. See clause 
8.7.5. 
As defined in 8.7.5, for DataWriters belonging to a Publisher with Presentation access scope GROUP, the 
Data submessages and the first DataFrag submessage of each sample shall contain the publisher writer info 
in-line QoS parameter. 
The End Coherent Set Data submessage (see clause 8.7.6) for those DataWriters shall also contain the 
publisher writer info in-line QoS parameter. 
9.6.4.6 
Secure Publisher Writer Info (PID_SECURE_WRITER_GROUP_INFO) 
The secure publisher writer info in-line QoS parameter uses the CDR encoding for WriterGroupInfo_t. See 
clause 8.7.5. 
The secure publisher writer info in-line QoS is reserved for DDS Security. In the cases when it is used it shall be 
added anywhere that the PID_WRITER_GROUP_INFO in-line QoS is required.  
9.6.4.7 
Original Writer Info (PID_ORIGINAL_WRITER_INFO) 
Following the CDR encoding, the wire representation of the OriginalWriterInfo_t (see 9.3.2) in-line QoS shall

The original writer info parameter may appear in the Data or in the DataFrag submessages. 
9.6.4.8 
KeyHash (PID_KEY_HASH) 
The key hash inline parameter contains the CDR encoding of the KeyHash_t. The KeyHash_t is defined as a 16-
Byte octet array (see 9.3.2) therefore the key hash inline parameter just copies those 16 Bytes. 
Given an Aggregated type "Foo" and an object “FooObject” of type “Foo”, the KeyHash_t computation for 
FooObject shall use the following algorithm: 
Step 1. Define a new type “FooKeyHolder” as follows:

## Page 194

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
 
188
• 
Start with FooKeyHolder being defined the same way as the original Foo type, except that the 
FooKeyHolder shall have extensibility kind 'FINAL’ (see DDS-XTYPES 1.3 clause 7.2.3). 
• 
If there are any key members, then remove the non-key members from FooKeyHolder. Otherwise, 
do not remove any members. 
• 
Reorder the members in ascending order of their memberId values. 
Step 2. Define a new object “FooKeyHolderObject” of type FooKeyHolder. Initialize the values of 
FooKeyHolderObject from the FooObject, by setting the members present in 
FooKeyHolderObject to the same values as the corresponding members in FooObject. 
Step 3. Apply steps 1 and 2 recursively to the members of FooKeyHolder if they are themselves Aggregated 
types (i.e., structure or union types). 
Step 4. Compute the PLAIN_CDR2 Big Endian Serialization (see DDS-XTYPES 1.3 clause 7.4.2) of 
FooKeyHolderObject. The serialization shall be performed on a buffer that is initially aligned to the 
maximum alignment in PLAIN_CDR2 (i.e., 4). Furthermore, any padding bytes added due to alignment rules 
shall be set to zero. 
Step 5.1 If the FooKeyHolder has a maximum serialized size that is less than or equal to 16 bytes, then then 
the KeyHash of FooObject shall be set to the result of Step 4, extended to 16 bytes. Padding bytes, if required 
to fill 16 bytes, shall be added at the end and set to zero. 
Step 5.2 If the FooKeyHolder has a maximum serialized size that is greater than 16 bytes, then the 
KeyHash_t of FooObject shall be set to the MD5 Hash of the serialized bytes obtained from Step 4.  
Note that according to the definition of the PLAIN_CDR2 serialization (see DDS-XTYPES 1.3 clause 7.4.2), 
the serialized bytes obtained in step 4 do not include any encapsulation header, type header, or member headers 
and use a maximum alignment of 4. 
Example 1: Assume the type "Foo" defined by the IDL shown below: 
@final 
struct Foo { 
    @key long id; 
    long x; 
    long y; 
}; 
Assume FooObject is an object of type Foo where the id member has been set to 0x12345678 the x 
member to 10 and the y field to 20. 
In this case FooKeyHolder is defined as: 
@final 
struct FooKeyHolder { 
    @key long id; 
}; 
And FooKeyHolderObject is an object of type FooKeyHolder with its id member set to 
0x12345678. 
The result of step 4 (PLAIN_CDR2 big endian serialization) is the 4-byte stream containing the bytes 
{ 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78 } 
The maximum serialized size of FooKeyHolder is 4 bytes so step 5.1 applies. Therefore, the KeyHash_t is 
the 16-octet array: 
{ 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78,  
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,

## Page 195

DDSI-RTPS v2.5 
 
189 
 
 
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,  
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 } 
Note that the added bytes needed to fill the 16 byte KeyHash_t array are set to zero. 
Example 2: Assume the type "Foo" defined by the IDL shown below: 
struct Foo { 
    @key string<12> label; 
    @key long long id; 
    long x; 
    long y; 
}; 
Assume FooObject is an object of type Foo where the label member has been set to "BLUE" the id 
member has been set to 0x123456789abcdef0, the x member to 10 and the y member to 20. 
In this case FooKeyHolder is defined as: 
@final 
struct FooKeyHolder { 
    @key string<12> label; 
    @key long long id; 
}; 
And FooKeyHolderObject is an object of type FooKeyHolder with its label member set to "BLUE" 
and id set to 0x123456789abcdef0. 
The result of step 4 (PLAIN_CDR2 big endian serialization) is the 20-byte stream containing the bytes: 
{ 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x05,  
  0x42, 0x4c, 0x55, 0x45, 
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 
  0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 
  0x9a, 0xbc, 0xde, 0xf0 } 
Note that the serialization of the id member is aligned to a 4-byte boundary (as specified in PLAIN_CDR2) 
and the padding bytes introduced ahead of the serialized id have been set to zero. 
The maximum serialized size of FooKeyHolder is 28 bytes: The serialization of the label member can take 
up to 17 bytes (4-byte length, 12 bytes the string contains the maximum 12 characters, and one extra byte for the 
terminating NUL). Serializing the id member after a maximum length string would require 11 more bytes (3 
bytes of padding to get to a 4-byte alignment plus 8 bytes for the long long). 
Given the maximum serialized size of FooKeyHolder, step 5.2 applies. Therefore, the KeyHash_t is obtained 
by computing an MD5 hash on the serialized stream from step 4, resulting in the 16-octet array: 
{ 0xf9, 0x1a, 0x59, 0xe3, 
  0x2e, 0x45, 0x35, 0xd9, 
  0xa6, 0x9c, 0xd5, 0xd9, 
  0xf5, 0xb6, 0xe3, 0x6e } 
Example 3: Assume the type "Foo" defined by the IDL shown below: 
@mutable 
struct Nested { 
    @key long m_long; 
    long u; 
    long w; 
}; 
 
@mutable 
struct Foo { 
    @id(40) @key  string<12> label;

    @id(20) long x; 
    @id(10) long y; 
}; 
Assume FooObject is an object of type Foo where the label member has been set to "BLUE", the 
m_nested member has been set to m_nested.m_long = 0x12345678, m_nested.u = 10 and 
m_nested.w = 20. Finally, the x and y members have been set to 100 and 200, respectively. 
In this case FooKeyHolder is defined as: 
@final 
struct NestedKeyHolder { 
    @key long m_long; 
}; 
 
@final 
struct FooKeyHolder { 
    @key @id(30) NestedKeyHolder m_nested; 
    @key @id(40) string<12>      label; 
}; 
Note that the members of FooKeyHolder (and NestedKeyHolder) have been reordered by their 
memberId. 
Step 2 sets the FooKeyHolderObject object of type FooKeyHolder to have its member label set to 
"BLUE" and m_nested.m_long = 0x12345678. 
The result of step 4 (PLAIN_CDR2 big endian serialization) is the 13-byte stream containing the bytes: 
{  0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78  
   0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x05,  
   0x42, 0x4c, 0x55, 0x45, 
   0x00  } 
The maximum serialized size of FooKeyHolder is 21 bytes: The serialization of the m_nested member 
takes 4 bytes and the label member can take up to 17 bytes (4-byte length, 12 bytes the string contains the 
maximum 12 characters, and one extra byte for the terminating NUL). 
Given the maximum serialized size of FooKeyHolder, step 5.2 applies. Therefore, the KeyHash_t is obtained 
by computing an MD5 hash on the serialized stream from step 4, resulting in the 16-octet array: 
{ 0x37, 0x4b, 0x96, 0xe2,  
  0xe7, 0x27, 0x23, 0x7f, 
  0x01, 0x6c, 0xc4, 0xce,  
  0xbb, 0x6e, 0xb7, 0x1e }  
9.6.4.9 
StatusInfo_t (PID_STATUS_INFO) 
The status info parameter contains the CDR encoding of the StatusInfo_t. The StatusInfo_t is defined as a 4-
Byte octet array (see 9.3.2) therefore the status info inline parameter just copies those 4 Bytes. 
The status info parameter may appear in the Data or in the DataFrag submessages. 
The StatusInfo_t shall be interpreted as a 32-bit worth of flags with the layout shown below: 
0...2..........8...............16..............24..............32 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|F|U|D| 
+--------------+---------------+---------------+----------------+

The flags represented with the literal ‘X’ are unused by this version of the protocol and should be set to zero by 
the writer and not interpreted by the reader so that they may be used in future versions of the protocol without 
breaking interoperability. 
The flags in the status info provide information on the status of the data-object to which the submessage refers. 
Specifically, the status info is used to communicate changes to the LifecycleState of a data-object instance. 
The current version of the protocol defines the DisposedFlag, the UnregisteredFlag, the FilteredFlag.  
The DisposedFlag is represented with the literal ‘D.’ 
D=1 indicates that the DDS DataWriter has disposed the instance of the data-object whose Key appears in the 
submessage. 
The UnregisteredFlag is represented with the literal ‘U.’ 
U=1 indicates that the DDS DataWriter has unregistered the instance of the data-object whose Key appears in 
the submessage. 
The FilteredFlag is represented with the literal ‘F.’ 
F=1 indicates that the DDS DataWriter has written as sample for the instance of the data-object whose Key 
appears in the submessage but the sample did not pass the content filter specified by the DDS DataReader. 
If both DisposedFlag==0 and UnregisteredFlag=0, then the data-object whose Key appears in the Submessage 
has InstanceState ALIVE in the DDS DataWriter. In this case the value of the FilteredFlag indicates whether the 
sample that was written for that data-object instance passed the reader-specified filter: FilteredFlag==0 indicates 
the sample passed the filter and FilteredFlag==1 indicates it did not pass the filter.  
Note that the protocol does not require that the DDS DataWriter propagates the "register" operation. Therefore, 
the DDS DataWriter can implement 'register' as a local operation. Since the DDS DataWriter register operation 
does not provide a data value propagating the register operation would be of limited use to the DataReader.

Serialized Payload Representation 
10.1 
Introduction 
 
The RTPS protocol transfers serialized application data in the SerializedPayload submessage element, 
see 9.4.2.12. The representation of the serialized application data is not part of the RTPS protocol. The RTPS 
protocol does not interpret the content of the SerializedPayload. It delivers them as an opaque set of 
bytes. It is the responsibility of the connectivity layer above the RTPS protocol to serialize and deserialize the 
application data objects into and from the SerializedPayload.  
 
However, to detect configuration errors, the RTPS protocol provides a mechanism to ensure that the RTPS 
Writer and Reader have a common understanding of the format used to represent the data in the 
SerializedPayload. This is defined in Section 10.2. 
 
In the case of DDS using RTPS the responsibility to serialize and deserialize the application data objects into 
and from the SerializedPayload rests with the DDS DataWriter and DataReader, respectively. In 
this situation, the content and format of the SerializedPayload is defined in sections 10.3 to 10.5. 
10.2 
SerializedPayloadHeader and Representation Identifier 
 
All SerializedPayload shall start with the SerializedPayloadHeader defined below. The header 
provides information about the representation of the data that follows. 
 
typedef octet RepresentationIdentifier[2]; 
typedef octet RepresentationOptions[2]; 
struct SerializedPayloadHeader { 
    RepresentationIdentifier representation_identifier; 
    RepresentationOptions representation_options; 
}; 
 
The SerializedPayloadHeader occupies the first four octets of the SerializedPayload as shown 
below: 
             
  0...2...........8...............16..............24..............32 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |   representation_identifier   |   representation_options      | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  ~                                                               ~ 
  ~  ... Bytes of data representation using a format that ...     ~ 
  ~  ... depends on the RepresentationIdentifier and options ...  ~ 
  ~                                                               ~ 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
 
The RepresentationIdentifier is used to identify the data representation used. The 
RepresentationOptions shall be interpreted in the context of the RepresentationIdentifier, 
such that each RepresentationIdentifier may define the representation_options that it 
requires. 
For alignment purposes, the CDR stream is logically reset at the position that follows the 
representation_options. Therefore, there should be no initial padding before the serialized data is 
added to the CDR stream5.  
 
5 Versions of the RTPS specification previous to version 2.4 did not clearly state where the CDR stream was reset for 
alignment purposes. Therefore implementations may need to take into account the vendor and protocol version when 
interpreting the Serialized Data.

10.3 
SerializedPayload for RTPS discovery built-in endpoints 
The SerializedPayload for the data messages associated with built-in discovery endpoints shall use the 
RepresentationIdentifier values and formats defined in Table 10.1 below.  
 
 
The current version of the protocol does not use the representation_options: The sender shall set the 
representation_options to zero. The receiver shall ignore the value of the 
representation_options.

 Example for Built-in Endpoint Data 
Following is the SerializedPayload element used by the SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsWriter to declare a 
DataReader. 
 
The DataReader is for Topic “Square” and type “ShapeType”. The DataReader has the Endpoint GUID 
c0:a8:02:05:00:00:3a:20:00:00:00:02:80:00:00:07, DESTINATION_ORDER kind

BY_SOURCE_TIMESTAMP, and DEADLINE period of 3 seconds. The remaining members have their default 
values, so they are not serialized into the SerializedPayload. 
 
The representation identifier is PL_LE, indicating little Endian representation. 
 
The corresponding SerializedPayload element has the following layout:

 Example for User-defined Topic Data 
 
Following is the SerializedPayload element used by an application DataWriter to send Data on the Topic 
“Square” with type “ShapeType” defined by the IDL below. The DataWriter uses PLAIN_CDR representation 
with encoding version 1 and Little Endian byte order. 
 
@final 
struct ShapeType { 
    @key string<64> color; 
    long x; 
    long y; 
    long size; 
}; 
 
The representation identifier is CDR_LE.  
The example uses a data value with color set to “BLUE”, x = 34, y = 100, size = 24
